0,"Feedback: Ambien/Stilnox vs Belsomra Hi,

I'm posting my feedback about these two ""Z drugs"" (namely zolpidem vs suvorexant).  In my country these are marketed as Stilnox and Belsomra respectively.

My feedback is:

1. Stilnox (Ambien) is much better than Belsomra;
2. Belsomra consistently created very disturbing vivid nightmares, that leave you shaken in the morning.  This did not happen with Stilnox.

Also XR is much better in both cases (no waking up during the night, like what happened with IR).",Zolpidem
1,"30 years of insomnia, and what finally made a difference \*Long post written by my partner, u/markfromsleepout \- posting on his behalf\*

About one year post nearly being hospitalized for lack of sleep I'm posting about my experience with severe insomnia because I am hoping it might be helpful to someone else on here suffering through the same thing.

**TLDR:** *I've always had problems sleeping. 2020 was the catalyst for a bout of insomnia that was so severe for me I did not think I would keep my sanity. I ended up buying almost every sleep aid or product imaginable - nothing worked. CBT-I from a clinical psychologist got me out of my spiral and back to some kind of normalcy.*

**My story**

I have memories of struggling with sleep as early as five years old. My mom (single parent) would regularly have trouble putting me to bed. I was a sleep-environment-sensitive kid. I often had repetitive or stressful thoughts in bed about the next day at school, homework, or issues with other kids (god only knows what I was worried about).

I remember my mom trying different techniques including playing classical music in my room to help me fall asleep easier. We would have anything and everything taped up against my bedroom windows to block light (blankets, garbage bags, jeans, and tin foil). We would sleep without heat in the winter to keep me cold.I was more sensitive to sleep issues than other kids (I was always that kid that could not fall asleep at sleepovers).

Funny enough, I think I inherited my sleep problems from my mom. She was a night shift nurse who struggled with getting enough sleep due to a brutal schedule and would nap regularly during the day.As a young adult (12–15), I developed into a night owl.

I remember middle school and high school being hell for me. I would often be up until at least 1 am if not later each night so 730am was never kind. I did not think anything was wrong other than that I constantly needed to chase sleep on the weekends. I would pass on morning weekend events and got less involved with sports that required waking up early.I had some issues in university, but I was able to skirt around them without changing because of my freedom to determine my class schedule. I picked all afternoon and night classes each semester.

My insomnia diagnosis came into play and things got tougher after university. I entered the workforce for the first time. Like everyone else, my schedule and freedom became rigid and uncompromising. My work as a lawyer in a big city started to take its toll on me. I bought sleep tracking tech (Fitbits, various headbands, various apps) and other sleep aids. I saw doctors who diagnosed possible causes and prescribed sleeping pills. I began using zopiclone and zolpidem for sleeping regularly. This was a habit I knew I ""should stop"" at some point but never got around to it.

The pandemic lockdown exacerbated my insomnia and 10Xed my work-life stress. Suddenly the company I was working at was facing some serious economic hardship and the stress was passed around to all of us. I was going most nights on 3–4 hours of sleep. Zopiclone and zolpidem, which I could usually count on to get me a solid 6+ hours in a pinch, suddenly no longer worked for me. My crutch had snapped, and I really needed it.

Those who have suffered from insomnia probably know what comes next. Things got bad. I started panicking about only getting 4+ hours of sleep for weeks. My relationships suffered, badly, and so did my work performance. I barely noticed because I was so afraid of what would happen if I could not sleep again. My bedroom became a trigger for anxiety. I seriously DREADED going to bed at night. During the day, I felt like a shell of my former self. I could not work or even read a lot of the time. I spent the day waiting and praying that I would finally get the sleep I needed not knowing if life would ever be the same for me.

I was in what I can only describe as a severe downward spiral for over two months. I worried I would lose my sanity. I was sure my brain was broken or that I was. During this period, I did everything possible to get my sleep back on track.

**What did not work:**

* **I bought expensive new bedding** like percale cotton sheets, a new down comforter, and a new mattress. I thought I must be waking up because I was too warm or too uncomfortable. “Maybe this new apartment is just warmer than my old one?” I started sleeping with the A/C on to cool my room to 16C in winter. This did not help at all for me.
* **I bought a second white noise machine** and spent even more money trying to black out the huge windows in my condo apartment (this experience later became the inspiration for a startup I created). Again, the reaction to investing in my sleep environment was wrong.
* **I bought a sleep-tracking headband and another sleep tracking app**. At this point, I needed these apps to track my sleep and see what was working and what was not. I wanted to experiment each night. What I found was that repeatedly seeing my dismal 3-4 hours of sleep made my anxiety worse. I wanted to stop looking after just a few nights.
* **Meditation before bed / Calm app nighttime stories** before bed. Doctors helped me get bloodwork and cortisol tests to show my stress at nighttime was off the charts. I know meditation works for some but it just did not work to reduce my nighttime stress for whatever reason.

**What did work:**

* **CBT-I with a clinical psychologist over two months was the most helpful thing I did.** Just talking to someone who understood what was happening helped because I was spending so much time in my daily life trying to hide it. The specialist had me do CBT-I exercises and held me accountable for my progress. She helped me realize that this period was temporary and that if I put in the work I would get results, even if they took some time to show up. I slowly started to get better.
* **Left my job.** Personally, my work stress had become toxic and the pandemic created a ton of issues at my workplace. I started my own business with my partner making portable blackout curtains (something I understood well because I always needed them). My partner and I took a big financial hit leaving our jobs to do this. The freedom and control over my own life were worth it for me. I did not even realize how much my job had been stressing me out until I left it. It seriously felt like the world off my shoulders.
* **Nightly gratitude exercises with my partner** (Hannah note: we do this together and it's wonderful for our relationship!). These worked better for me in reducing stress than meditation or bedtime stories. We still say ten things we are grateful for and emphasize why we are grateful for them every night. Meditation might work better than this for others.
* **Religious bedtime and wake time.** I learned from sleep specialists that I had constantly experienced jet lag by waking at a certain time on weekdays and trying to “catch up” on weekends. I wish I knew how badly this strategy was affecting me earlier in my life. I seriously probably spent 9/10 weekends of my life feeling like I needed to ""catch up"" from my lack of sleep during the week.
* **The bedroom is only for sleep and sex.** To this day our bedroom is a dark cave and we only go inside of it when we are ready to sleep. This is what sleep specialists would call ""stimulus control"". Our bodies are ancient hardwired mechanisms. When you only associate a place and time with a specific thing (sleep in my case), eventually the body will get it.

\-----

I consider my insomnia diagnosis to be largely ‘dealt with’ now. I still struggle and have a horrible week once every couple of months or so where I do not get sleep, but I know now when these bouts occur that they will pass.

I have made peace with being more sensitive to sleep schedules, sleep environments, and stress before bed than the average person. Once I accepted that and put the necessary lifestyle changes in place, insomnia stopped being such a big deal for me. I realize now that my insomnia fed on my panicked reactions to it.

My beliefs about lack of sleep (I’ll never catch up, I’ll always be like this, I’ll have heart problems, I’ll lose my sanity eventually) caused one night’s poor sleep to turn into weeks’ long bouts of no sleep. For me, talking to professionals and following the right strategies made all the difference.

For others struggling with this right now, I want you to know that **there are strategies that will make you feel normal again** and that what you are experiencing, even if more exacerbated and longer than I did, will eventually pass.",Zolpidem
2,"Is it too early for me to taper off Zolpidem (Ambien)? Long story short after having my Pfizer vaccine I was left with some strange symptoms and a flare up of my chronic fatigue, one of the new symptoms was insomnia where I couldn't sleep at all for 8 days straight trying different medications until my doc prescribed me Zolpidem and it finally worked, originally for only several hours but now it usually works for 4-6 hours, I wake up at night stay in bed for another 2-3 hours and eventually have somewhat shallow but full of dreams sleep in the morning where I keep altering between wakefulness and sleep every hour or so. Altogether I've been managing to get between 4-8h of sleep (Before this episode I'd sleep around 7-9h a night)

I keep reading about how bad Zolpidem is and I wonder if it's a good time to try and taper off even though my sleep is still bad (although improved while on it compared to one month ago), I've been on it for 1.5 months now and taking 10mg every night. I tried going down to 7.5mg a couple weeks back and I only slept 2 hours, that scared me and I went back to full dose. Yesterday I tried going down to 9mg and I had around 5h of broken up sleep which I guess is better than nothing but considerably worse than what I get on 10mg.

Still another week to see my treating GP so I wonder what peoples experiences have been with coming off Ambien vs staying on it. Is it even possible to get better sleep without it?",Zolpidem
3,"Insomnia every time I need to wake up earlier than usual I work from home and most days I work late. So I end up sleeping late and waking up late. I don't set an alarm clock and just wake up naturally, sometimes 8am, sometimes 9am. During such nights I have no trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.

But if I have to wake up at a fixed time, whether it's  30mins or an hour earlier, my anxiety kicks in. Even if it is for something innocuous like meeting friends for breakfast. I end up falling asleep at 4am or 5am, and I often just end up canceling the event if I can. If it's for a work meeting, then I'm screwed and have to suffer through the day. 

I used to take Zolpidem and it worked, but I've weaned myself off it and no longer have any at home. Anyone else like me?",Zolpidem
4,I just started taking a very low dose mirtazapine for insomnia and anxiety. Im worried about the weight gain. Did you guys gain a lot of weight even on a small dose? Ive read stories where some people didn't gain any weight on a higher dose. This medicine rly does help me fall asleep and stay asleep unlike Ambien (zolpidem). The only thing is that I feel drowsy/tired the next morning.,Zolpidem
5,"Using Zolpidem/Ambien Hi, after some arguments with my current doctor about how not sleeping is worse than taking sleeping pills he finally gave me package of Zolpidem. I took one pill as prescribed ( on an empty stomach without any alcohol consumed prior) and crashed on my gf's coach within 30 minutes. The problem is that I woke up shortly after and couldn't get back to sleep until the morning, when I already had to wake up. Should I keep taking it to try and see if the body needs to get used to it or can I conclude it as ineffective?",Zolpidem
6,"Cycling different sleeping aids to avoid tolerance and addiction, any thoughts? I'm dealing with insomnia for a year or so, the cause is not really clear but is probably related to my bipolar disorder. I've tried several sleeping pills with mixed results. My psychiatrist will not prescribe trazodone or remeron. I've tried otc stuff like unisom and also phenergan but I tend to get terrible headaches from these. I can't use weed. 

 I'm trying to find a schedule cycling different sleeping aids. I'm hoping to avoid tolerance and addiction, and I also hope to be able to use these meds for longer periods without negative side effects. My doctor is fine with this idea. I'm hoping you can provide some more ideas. 


My schedule:

- melatonin, 1 or 2 mg, 3/4 times per week (I get maybe 5 hours of broken sleep, I wake up 3 times at least)

- quetiapine, 12,5 mg, 2 times per week (does work very well but sometimes I get a nasty next day hangover)

- restoril, 10mg., 1 time per week (works great)

- zolpidem, 5 mg., 1 time per week (I sleep for five hours and then I'm unable to get to sleep again).


I'm thinking of swapping the zolpidem for zopiclone, hoping that might work longer. 

If it wasn't addictive and if tolerance effects didn't exist then I probably would take the restoril everyday. 

Do you have any thoughts regarding this cycling of meds? Any other ideas? Thanks!",Zolpidem
7,"Any experience with Zaleplon / Sonata? Help I used zolpidem/ambien  and various benzos before but recently got prescribed Sonata. 1 pill - 10mg before bed.

Now I have 15 pills left, can I chill smh?

8,"Sleep and body going into callopse/freeze Hi,

Anyone familiar with how trauma affects the body, and particularly the callopse state. My body goes into psychical callopse and sometimes when I try to sleep, it goes into this horrible callopse/freeze out(it's not sleep)and in the morning I feel so scared and feel absolutely awful.

I have been struggling badly with sleep and tonight I want to take sleeping meds zolpidem(I tried zopiclone and it was awful)doctor said try zolpidem and I have not used it yet but want to tonight. 

I was wondering if the medication helps you get good sleep even when my body is in state of callopse/fight sometimes

9,"Doctor laughed in my face So after 5 months of the worst insomnia I’ve ever had in my life (average of 2-3 hours of sleep every SINGLE night, with many nights of no sleep at all), resulting in severe depression and suicidal thoughts every day, have tried EVERYTHING you can name or think of that doesn’t require prescription, even Zopiclone and zolpidem didn’t work), I finally went to a Private GP (I live in the U.K.) and I told him everything and said I wanted to get tested for sleep apnea and ADHD (as I have all of the symptoms and also am friends with someone who has it) he literally started laughing and said I need to “stop googling and just relax”. The entire time I just wanted to burst out crying, and as soon as I left I just cried my eyes out. No one can fucking help me, no one, all I want is to die as soon as possible because I can’t take this anymore.

10,zolpidem and zopiclone hi guys. i switched from zolpidem to zopiclone few days ago. the latter seems to work better for me but i noted the hours i get to sleep are so inconsistent even on both drugs. sometimes 2 hours the other times 5-6 hours. what is the reason for this inconsistency? do any of you encounter this issue and raise it with your psychiatrist? thanks,Zolpidem
11,"I can’t get out of my head. Anxiety/fear/worry Whatever started this, it’s definitely mental now. The fear and worry is now constant every night. I’m constantly checking to see if I’m sleeping. I am afraid. :( My fears and worries are getting darker.

I was very excited yesterday morning because I dreamed - first time I’ve remembered a weirdo jacked up dream in way over a month. I actually felt human for a few hours. I had forgotten how great it felt to wake up even a little refreshed instead of defeated… I got all the way to REM! 

I decided to just try to rest for a few hours instead of the Pass/Fail exam of sleeping I’ve been doing. Instead of guided meditations I found some sleep hypnosis things on YouTube. I’d listen to one, then acknowledge that I rested a bit, maybe get up and pee, get some water, pet the cat, choose another video. I did this starting at 8:30 and around 3-4a.m. started noticing that I was feeling more “floaty” and relaxed. I liked the affirmations that I was hearing. I started repeating a few from Nick Wright (just stumbled across him). At around 6:00, I took off my headphones and suddenly WOKE from a goofy vivid dream. It was shortly after 8. So, I finally fell asleep, even if for only two hours. I was so excited. I felt almost normal again yesterday, until I got tired, but still like there has been progress. I was kind of excited to try again last night. I hadn’t taken much either, and nothing after I went to bed.

I didn’t sleep last night. I didn’t even feel trance-like or drifts last night. Wtf? It’s like I was resisting the effort. 

Tomorrow will be 8 weeks since I got a decent night’s sleep. One week ago I got a new physician, she has me taking mirtazapine 15mg plus 10mg melatonin at the same time each night. I was doing this, albeit not as regimented, I’m not overly hopeful that in 2-4 weeks I’ll begin sleeping. I’ve also used unisom, Benadryl, trazodone, seroquel, tryptophan, even ambien/zolpidem. My brain has decided to rebel against everything. The ambien worked for 5 hours of crappy sleep - for the first week. Now i don’t fall asleep on any of it.

I don’t know why my brain is fighting sleep so bad. I’m exhausted. I love sleep. There is no joy in telling anyone I still didn’t sleep. Sleep has become unfamiliar. I’m having a very hard time being kind to myself. I don’t understand why I’m “overthrowing” everything. I’m so frustrated. This weekend I tried to accept that this is more than likely psychological. My thyroid was fine. The new physician said there are not tons of things to check. Falling asleep yesterday after hypnosis tracks seemed to verify this. I’m not liking myself very much right now.",Zolpidem
12,"Deep sleep time pass. I'm 21 an usually sleep 4-5 hours even if I go to bed early and wake up at the same time. But those 4 hours feel like I wasn't sleeping at all and was conscious the entire night. The alarm wakes me up instantly.

I don't get anymore into this deep sleep state that makes you feel time pass. ( you know as a kid you would touch the pillow and it's already mourning? So now it doesen't happen. )

Sometimes I may get some rest during the day and experience 1 hour of super vivid nightmares that wake me up drenched in sweat and gasping for air...

I've been taking zolpidem for some time but it makes me feel like someone knocked me out and after 5 hours I would wake up feeling like shit.

I almost never feel rested and getting out of bed is difficult.",Zolpidem
13,"I'm just gonna take some benzo or Zolpidem the rest of my life. Has anyone ever actually taken benzos etc that they developed tolerance so high it was implausible to keep taking these drugs ? 

I couldn't care less if I am addicted / dependent as I can commit to taking the rest of my life. 

I took Clonazepam for about 1 year straight + Xanax (both 2mg) then stopped and was fine 

I have seen some people take Clonazepam for many years for some other conditions so it must be totally plausible to do this in certain circumstances and consider chronic insomnia and anxiety a worthwhile one.",Zolpidem
14,"Insomnia - any diagnoses besides anxiety/depression ? I’m so frustrated right now, it’s been five weeks since I’ve slept decent. And it wasn’t great before that. I’ve been working with my psychologist on everything since this started the first week of November, and three weeks later she had me contact my primary doctor because she can’t find a psychiatric reason. The primary care doctor met with me virtually. He has not been helpful, and it’s obvious from his notes that he is not considering this is anything but psychiatric problems, even though I’ve given him all the info from the psychologist. After zero results with his various trazodone, seroquel, and mirtazepine combinations. I finally got angry Friday on the phone and told his nurse that I need help and I don’t feel like they are listening to me. I hadn’t been able to even fall asleep at all the two nights previous. (“Cut the trazodone dose in half” was the last grand gesture from him).

That evening I picked up a prescription of zolpidem / ambien. I’ve been sleeping about 5-6 hours the past four nights using that, but I’m still exhausted. And once I wake at 3:00-4:00 I can’t get back to sleep. I’ve been unable to nod off and take a nap since this began five weeks ago.

My psychologist is frustrated because she feels this warrants at least basic lab tests. I’ve asked three times for a referral to a specialist and they’ve ignored me. I’m frustrated and tired. I sent an update yesterday, that I’m taking the ambien, sleeping about five hours, I’m not well rested. 
I would like a plan. A nurse wrote back with “you need to cut out caffeine and not use screens before bedtime”. I’m so pissed. I’ve been working on this for five weeks and I’m well beyond this advice! 

I know they won’t continue to prescribe ambien… and that they’ll implement drug testing if I want more. Yet, their message with the prescription was that it’s to get me enough rest so *I* can figure it out. Ffs! 

I just want to add that I’m not opposed to using psych meds, if I need them. I took various combinations for over 20 years, for better and worse. I’ve got a psychologist saying I don’t need them and a family doctor who wants me on high seroquel for insomnia. I think i need a new physician.",Zolpidem

Anyway for the last 4 nights I’ve probably slept the best I have in months. I’ve been so desperate to get this amount of sleep for months. However, I’ve found my already existing moderate anxiety has worsened and I’ve been increasingly sad. It’s not my first time taking zolpidem, I tried it a handful of times a month ago but didn’t have much success with it by itself.  In hindsight I believe I struggled with sadness on those days too.

If you are only searching for a specific part, feel free to skip to that segment, otherwise i suggest you go through it in entirety. If you are the analytical type like myself, i hope the extra internal dialogue segments will help you out. **Note that not all of the advices might work for you, so only take what resonates with you**, though feel free to at least give each of them a shot if you are unsure. Some of you are browsing this subreddit on a regular basis, so you have likely heard a lot of what is about to follow. I came to this place only when in dire need of answers, so i want to provide the kind of condensed help i wish i found when this first happened to me. It is also worth pointing out that **my issue was the initial phase of falling asleep, not the constant waking up at night**. It has now been almost a full year since the start of chronic insomnia and i would say that my current night experiences are very close to what they were before insomnia with \~90% of the fear of insomnia gone.

# How it started

Insomnia was always always foreign to me. I never had sleep issues and could sleep pretty much everywhere. Or so i thought. There were a few events in my life that i didn't put enough attention on, and that is when there was a ""big stressful event"" coming up. Every so often, there would be something such as for example a driving license exam, a job interview, a very important presentation, some event that i would be subconsciously dreading. My conscious mind wouldn't feel like it was such a big deal, but underneath there was anxiety. So every few years when such events came up, i couldn't sleep. When it actually started being hell for me was when i noticed that i couldn't fall asleep for an hour or two. That's when the true fear really came. Running thoughts, temperature swings, knot in my stomach so i couldn't eat anything and when i became hungrier as time went on, the hunger + anxiety made me feel so ill. I felt trapped with no way out, alone and with no-one that could help me. Even if there would be someone there, what can they do? Say ""calm down""? This is certainly not something i can ring up Emergency for and even then, what can they do?

So my mind went spiraling into this feeling of helplessness and i was feeling more and more overwhelmed. I couldn't do anything but wait for the morning, knowing it's going to be a long and painful wait. I tried to eat a few biscuits or a small piece of bread every few hours and barely stuffed anything down my stomach. However, when the morning came, i wanted to get the event done with as soon as possible, putting some cold water on my face, shrugging off the lack of sleep and basically get this sh\*t done. And... that was it. The next day, i could sleep normally and i have soon forgotten about this nightmare, which happened every few years so i just ignored to look for the root of it and simply said i'm glad it's over.

Until... I couldn't do that anymore. You see, 2020/2021 were the times of dealing with our baggage and the times where it was thrown right in our face so we can't ignore it anymore. Needless to say that in the start of 2021, i was suddenly facing the same nightmare scenario, only this time there was no event next day, yet the same fear was present. Turns out that the event was only the trigger for making it harder to fall asleep, but the actual anxiety came from the traumatic feeling that i was not in control, i was helpless and that not being able to sleep means a long painful night full of terrors that will cause massive frustration. And indeed it did. The first time it happened at the start of the year, i couldn't even take a nap the next day and my body was often shaking. The anxiety and stomach issues lasted for a week, gradually fading each day. Once i was ""normal"" again, i shrugged it off and went back to work, only to get a repeat scenario two weeks later. Now a new fear arose. What if this is going to happen continuously and my life will be a constant struggle of insomnia and anxiety. It just didn't make any sense why this is happening and i felt powerless and not in control.

# The process of unraveling

The day after not being able to sleep, i was of course feeling devastated. I also couldn't eat and it felt like being stuck in Dante's inferno. After the initial shock, the first remedy to ease the anxiety came naturally...

&#x200B;

**WALKING (huge effect)**

As simple as it sounds, it did wonders for me. It was a combination of the physical act of walking that shifted the focus. I was primarily walking in nature so the change of scenery added a lot to it as well. The activity itself simply grounds me, which is what you need if you are in your head too much dealing with insomnia. I was rarely bothered to take a walk up to 2021, but suddenly it's one of my favorite things to do. I dare to say that i was even forced to embrace it, as the body-mind simply required it, and now it remains to feel good. At first i was either walking 1 to 2 hours before ""bed time"" so it cleared my thoughts a bit and allowed me to shift my focus from dreading the anticipated night, or right after a sleepless night to shake off the anxiety in the morning. This was also helpful to adjust my mindset before starting work in the morning (work from home) if i was not on sick leave. What walking at night or in the woods also allowed me was to dig deep. To introspect and talk to myself (yes, out loud). I introspected why a relapse occurred, what am i being afraid of when i can't sleep, what's the worse case scenario, how much toll does it actually take on my body and mind compared to the belief of how horrible a sleepless night was etc.

Up to this day, this is still something i swear by and now enjoy doing regardless of sleep. What i was also doing at that starting point when insomnia was at its worst and i was still trying to find out what's going on was...

&#x200B;

**Medication (small effect)**

Medication was, as for most if not all people, the logical conclusion once you feel out of control and simply want it to stop. My initial reaction to insomnia and anxiety that came from it was, that this is the worst thing that ever happened to me (if you finish reading you will see why that is no longer true) and i am desperately trying to fix it. I was at first taking a prescription sleep aid (generally known as Zolpidem) and while it did help me fall asleep, the repeats kept on coming and i was no closer to fixing it. Not only did the medication not cure the root reason, but it also got my body used to sleeping aid in order to fall asleep. Once i noticed this, i changed to over the counter version of antihistamines and gradually dosed down until i felt like i am stable enough without them. Something that i noticed made a huge difference in allowing me to get off the meds was...

&#x200B;

**Acceptance (huge effect)**

This is something that actually allowed me to cure the root cause of insomnia. Not only did i have to accept, that insomnia is not something i can get rid of in a moment, so **it may last for a while and** **that's okay**, but also gradually accepted that not sleeping is not the end of the world. As mentioned above, throughout insomnia I have discovered that i was afraid of not having control over how my night will go. Not having control over when i fall asleep or no clue how to even ""do it"". I had to accept that i cannot ""do it"". I cannot force sleep. I was also trying to find some mental tricks in order to bypass the blockage and somehow drift into sleep, which was just counter productive. I was also one of the ""lucky"" people to get constant muscle spasms as soon as i was on the brink of sleep, preventing me to actually cross into sleep. This also made me more aware that i was about to fall asleep, which just increased the mental focus again. An endless cycle of **frustration that** **i was trying to avoid**. And that was the core mistake. Only once i fully embraced what was happening without any judgement and looked at it from a positive perspective of getting out of this stronger with less subconscious trauma, was when i started to see good progress. Looking back at this, such a simple tool is so strong, yet so rarely mentioned out there. It definitely took some browsing to find out about this approach and some introspection / meditation to apply it.

I bought the commonly mentioned e-book on this topic by Dr. Guy Meadows ([https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/1499250533](https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/1499250533)). I would highly suggest it, though i honestly read only the first half of it, but that was enough for me to get the point and apply it in practice. I changed my point of view of fearing the night and accepted whatever comes with open arms. It took some time but i eventually came to the point where even if i didn't fall asleep for 4 hours, i was actually still very calm and not affected by the whole situation, far from the previous version of dante's inferno, dreading soon after realizing it's one of those nights again. **Acceptance is key, resistance brings more resistance**. Accepting that i can't do anything specific to make sleep come faster and that the body knows how to do it on it's own, while the ""me"" thoughts are just in the way of it. Note that i didn't go as far as personifying my emotions and fears as the book suggests, but i welcomed all that came none the less.

&#x200B;

**Tricks of the mind (small effect)**

As mentioned above, i got to a point where lying in bed for hours and hours without sleep was no longer scaring the crap out of me (literally, lol). That's when i also started to notice a few point of view changes besides acceptance that i want to share here.

You see, i noticed a few times that i couldn't sleep for the whole night and after the 100th bathroom visit, i was wondering what the time was, as if i won't fall asleep, i might as well get up and start my work early and go for a walk. I see that i have 2 hours until alarm goes off, but i could technically get up in 40 minutes and ""start my day"". That **relieved the sleep pressure** and gave me the freedom to just lie down in a win-win scenario. I am either going to fall asleep, or will soon be done with this. I decided just to casually rest in bed and behold, i actually fell asleep and be woken by the alarm clock. So after a few of such events, whenever sleep was taking a long time to come (*note that i did not write ""whenever i had issues of sleep taking a long time"", as at this point i was not looking at it as an issue anymore, but just a happening*), apart from just accepting as mentioned above, i also took a perspective that i am not lying here ""trying to sleep"", but only resting. Just like you are resting on the couch during a nap, you have **no expectations**.

Which brings us to the topic of **naps**. What i found out (after being exhausted due to lack of sleep and then eventually forced to take a nap in order to function semi-normally), was to pay attention on how it felt to fall asleep during the nap. During dealing with insomnia, we overthink it so much on HOW to fall asleep, that we miss the obvious. Did you notice how effortless the nap was? What did you do to fall asleep during the nap? Exactly... nothing. And that attitude is what i transferred to sleeping in the evening as well. There is more expectation at night because much more is ""hanging on the line"" compared to an effortless afternoon nap, but that's only in our minds, a mere matter of perspective that you can change. Regarding the practicality of naps, i usually kept them between 30 minutes to 1h 30 minutes, depending on what my body required. I got up even if i was still feeling tired. It was still better if i pushed through the day avoiding the nap if possible, so i advise to only take naps when you absolutely must, otherwise not napping will generally help you regain the sleep drive cycle quicker.

Another thing i noticed i was starting to do was regarding thoughts when i laid in bed. Naturally, unless i was dead tired, the thoughts started to become more active when i turned off the lights. After many nights of getting in the way of myself working and managing thoughts, i found a good way of ""dealing"" with them. Imagine holding a tight clenched fist out of anger. You then realize what you are doing and you start to gradually release the grip. Imagine a mother watching over her child playing outside. You are worried he might get hurt and feel overprotective over the child. But then you realize that kids have to play and explore on their own, so you let go of your overprotective fears. It's a lot like that. You are noticing the thoughts, but instead of ""doing"" something with them once you notice them, you just gently let go. **The act of letting go is not a doing either**, it is just a natural acceptance that they are there, that they will be fine without your attention and that you can let go.

&#x200B;

**Wim Hof method (big effect)**

We talked about the walks. This goes hand in hand with them, and more. For those who are not familiar with Wim Hof, this guy tackled his trauma with breathing and cold therapy and holds a multitude of world records related to amazing feats. He also has it scientifically backed by doctors doing lab work on him. If you need more proof, google is your friend. I still do the Wim Hof method whenever i feel like it, and it still does wonders. I will split this into two parts:

* Breathing (big effect)The breathing exercise was often a life saver. Note that i was doing it on my own pace and length, but you can find the basic guided exercise for beginners here ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&t=1s))Not only did the breathing help my body release endorphins (happy) and lower cortisol (stress), but it also gave me such a mental cleansing and sense of peace. Even during my most anxious evening mind moments, this brought me down to ""okay to slightly nervous"", while on mornings after insomnia, it just wiped my mind clean. I did the breathing before my morning walk and i was actually able to sense so much joy and understanding during the walk instead of brooding over the previous night. I also sometimes use this pre-meditation, to wipe my mind, but that's beside the point. Also since i've mentioned meditation, note that during insomnia / anxiety i was actually not able to meditate effectively to calm myself down, while this breathing really did.
* Cold showers (medium effect)Some people report great physical sensation after the cold showers. For me, cold showers represented the discipline and dedication part. Of course the body was telling me that the cold is uncomfortable so make it stop, but i was determined and focused on two things. Breathing deeply as relaxed as possible, and most importantly, **finding peace within the chaos**. I was channeling my inner zen monk, sitting in peace during a riot in the background. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist brain to see how this ties to insomnia and the mind attacks fearing the outcome. This will only help you stand in your acceptance with even greater strength. If you do decide to go with the routine of cold showers, look it up first and follow Wim's advice! **Gradual cold exposure and no forcing**. I will be honest, when a day way super rough and i didn't feel that well, i skipped the shower and only did the breathing, so always listen to your body, but know when your mind is tricking you for comfort.

&#x200B;

**Common advices that did and did not work for me**

Of course some of the things you first stumble upon are sleep hygiene and herbal supplements. The way i feel about this is that **you generally want to avoid making an event / ritual about ""going to bed""**. If you have read up to this point, you likely understand why. Here are some of the things from the top of my head:

**Did not work:**

* Sleep aid tea - this one actually if anything, made it worse as my stomach was full of liquid, making it physically less comfortable.
* Melatonin - tried it with various times and doses, no noticeable effect.
* Herbal supplement (*Ashwagandha*) - i tried two different kinds, one regular grind of bigger quantity and the other one a specialized Sensoril version. I can put the normal one into a maybe pile, as the first time i took it during the day i did notice being more mellow, but the pills were so huge it was tough to swallow. I then started ingesting the powder together with honey on a spoon and it didn't feel like it was as potent. Sensoril on the other hand did nothing for me.
* No TV before bedtime - More on this later.
* If you don't fall asleep, get out of bed - This one just made the act of going to sleep even a bigger event. I just stayed in bed and changed my point of view to resting (see chapters above) instead of constantly getting out and trying again. I did try getting up and solving sudoku puzzles while attempting to bore myself, but it just felt like avoidance. At rare occasions this does make sense if you sense it super early like 10 minutes into lying down, but over time you will get a good sense of when you feel like you are tired enough to go to bed, which prevents this from happening in the first place.
* Therapy - i don't want to go too deep into this as it would be unfair, but i will just add that i have explored this option and set up an appointment with a cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) specialist. It turned out that i was not resonating with the therapist, but it also made me realize that i want to handle this on my own. I understood that i am the most capable individual on the planet to solve my issues, as they are happening to me, but i am in no way saying therapy wouldn't work for you.
* Cannabis oil / paste - No particular positive effect.
* Weighted blanket - I'm a hot sleeper so it got hot really quickly, though the weight did have an interesting feeling. Would recommend everyone to try it out and return it if it doesn't work for you.
* Music / Audio that helps you sleep - I just can't log out if i have any sounds in the background so the lulling music, relaxing bedtime stories or asmr doesn't help me sleep, but it might work for you.

**Did work:**

* Only go to bed when you are tired - i fought against this one for so long as i wanted to stick to sleep schedules to induce sleepiness (another thing i read, but you will find this in the maybe pile below). Ultimately i found out that it was better that i stayed up an hour or two later and only get 6 hours of sleep before i had to get up for work, compared to going to bed as planned and then having 0 or 1 hour of sleep. I still extend my bed timer for 30 or 60 minutes sometimes if i really don't feel like i'm sleepy enough, but with a more normalized sleep patterns, you will have to do this less and less.
* Unwinding - This one is a double edged sword, but i will keep it in the did work pile. The reason why it can be negative is if again you turn the unwinding into a ritual that you absolutely must do in order to be able to sleep. People suggest things like hot showers for example. I tried that, and while it may have worked sometimes, my mind felt like if i skipped a shower, i won't be able to sleep. I also found that going to bed straight after mentally stimulating activates, such as strategic video games doesn't work well. So i found out my personal way of unwinding while still keeping ita) flexibleb) entertainingc) non mandatoryand that was watching TV series with my wife on the couch. If you snuggle up under a blanket and call it your personal time to relax, it has an even better emotional effect. Just don't look at this as a requirement for sleep, but find natural way to chill in the evening. Some people like to read books or listen to music, experiment, keep it non mandatory and leave the time flexible according to your needs (you maybe won't need to unwind at all as you are very tired, or maybe you are not tired at all even after 1h of watching TV. **That's okay!**).
* Getting up in the morning (even if still tired) - I will admit that i snoozed quite a few times because being sleep deprived is not fun, but this did naturally boot up a sleep cycle again. It just makes sense.
* If you wake up to go to the bathroom, ignore your thoughts - This one i added from the top of my head as i didn't really read it anywhere, but i find it hard to fall asleep again if i wake up at 6am and then start to entertain my thoughts when i lie back down. Also getting a dim night light that works on motion detection is very nice, so you don't have to be blinded by your bathroom lights, thus maintaining the drowsy state.

&#x200B;

**Sort of works:**

* Dimming lights / blue light filters - While this didn't make a difference on it's own, i guess this one doesn't hurt to put in effect regardless of insomnia. Brighter lights strain your eye more, so at least it helps your eye muscles to relax more if you turn them off or dim them when it's getting late, thus the physical feel of sleepiness is more present. I use f.lux app on my PC cutting blue light after 6pm, but i'm that kind of guy that sets brightness to minimum and cuts blue light at day as well because i have sensitive eyes. You might want to cut down your TV brightness as well if you watch it in the evening for unwinding to a level that if you close your eyes, your eyelids aren't seeing bright flashes from moving pictures on the screen and you can do some mini dozing off during the unwinding.
* Talking about your insomnia experience - Again a double edged sword. I talked heaps with my wife and often got tired of me rambling, saying i kept repeating the same things. The reason why this can also be negative is if you are an analytical overthinker, you can bury your head so deep into the sand while trying to understand the whys and the hows, that you start to become obsessed with it or simply making it a bigger deal than it deserves to be. At the same time sharing with someone makes you feel understood or at least not as lonely as insomnia can sometimes be.

**Additional help**

I would highly recommned the following youtube channel, as it was very helpful to me in multiple ways. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\_tdQDMQon0CfD0xAbZPNDg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tdQDMQon0CfD0xAbZPNDg/videos)First off, it is hosted by someone that went through what you are going through. Secondly, it hosts people that were also in your shoes and explain their way of dealing with it, essentially what you just read but in a more streamlined interview / chat way. It helps you see how common this issue is, yet how manageable it is as well. And thirdly, you can ask questions or help others in the comment section that are feeling lost. It's just a great community full of positive vibes, which is what you want when you are feeling like being in downward spiral! :) It also helped me understand why these fears are popping up and helped me find ways to deal with it. It was helpful for me to think about insomnia and processing it during the day instead of hiding away from it and hoping it will pass. Just make sure you don't go into overthinking mode about it lol, but that's when grounding walks in nature come in, helping you disconnect if needed.

# Conclusion

So there you go. If you read all the way to the end, you should have a good picture of what my journey of processing this experience was like, how i tackled it and hopefully giving you some ideas for you to try as well. We are all unique, so i would like to point out again - please feel free to only take what resonates with you and leave whatever doesn't. I can also genuinely say that during this journey through insomniaville, i have gained new understandings about myself, dug deeper than before and am generally grateful that this experience has happened. Tough things in life always suck at first, but you later find out why you had to go through it and it makes you stronger. Here's to everyone staying strong during your personal battles, know that you are loved and supported. You are never alone.",Zolpidem
20,"Is it safe to mix a small amount of zolpidem with melatonin? I don't have a sleeping disorder, but this seemed to be the best place to ask. I have a condition that has been causing me to wake up 2-5 times a night for the last few years. It got much worse around spring, and I would go into REM sleep very quickly, so I started taking zolpidem sulphate. It allowed me to get 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep at first, but I built up a tolerance to it very quickly.

I've made two unsuccessful attempts to quit in the last two months. The first time I tried to go cold turkey, and the second time I properly tapered down from 10mg a night to 2.5mg, but was only able to get around 6 hours of heavily interrupted sleep a night. I heard that switching to melatonin works for many people, but I heard that mixing it with zolpidem isn't recommended. I don't get enough rest with only 2.5mg zolpidem a night, so I'd like to try mixing it before quitting completely. Should this be safe?",Zolpidem
21,Is anyone else going through this kind of insomnia? Going crazy here Since march of 2019 i started having insomnia which has been progressively worse.

Seriously sleep deprived and been losing weight. Im here fearing the worse can anyone give insight if you've been through this?,Zolpidem
22,"CBN for long-term sleep problems - any experiences? Hello, I have been struggling with sleep problems for a very long time. I need to take zolpidem 7.5mg with promethazine 25mg(an antihistamine drug) every night, to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep. For most of the nights, a combination of zolpidem + promethazine works, but not always. And sometimes, even after 8 hours of sleep, I feel like I wasn't sleeping at all (I feel exhausted, tired...but I can't go back to sleep during the day or take a nap). I also take valerian (800mg), melatonin (6mg)...but they work more or less like a placebo.

Recently I bought a CBN oil from a Swiss company (it's THC free). I've been taking it every night for about a month. The recommended dosage is 3-5 drops under the tongue before sleep (it's 300mg/10ml bottle). 

In the beginning, I had an impression that it was helping a little (it made me feel a bit more tired, sleepy), but still, I couldn't fall asleep without taking zolpidem. Even with 5 drops, I may wake up during the night, and not be able to fall asleep afterward. 

&#x200B;

Can you please share your experiences with CBN for sleep? Should I try to take more drops? Is there an even better-stronger cannabinoid variant, especially for sleep problems? 

&#x200B;

I am located in eastern Europe, I can only try THC-free products.

24,"I’m so glad I found you guys… Hi, I’m a 27yo mom, and the past year I’ve been diagnosed with “severe progressive insomnia”. I’ve had a sleepy study where they were unable to tell me what’s wrong with my sleep, but can easily see that it’s really bad. I’ve been on Zolpidem for over a year now and I’m at the max dose and have to supplement melatonin to be able to maintain sleep. 

I am not resting. My body is extremely weak and tired, and my brain is rotting at this point. I’m waiting on approval for a brain scan/MRI because I’m now having memory gaps and losing memories. Before my pregnancy I only ever took 10mg melatonin maybe twice a week to sleep. After having my son I am now at the point I’ll go 4 days straight without sleep if I don’t have medication for it. It’s happened before.

Is there any other testing I can get done for this? Cause being 27 and literally forgetting memories and people and being on this controlled substance has been very hard on me.",Zolpidem
25,"Long-term sleep problems and sleep medications Hello, besides suffering from anxiety and depression, I have been also struggling with sleep problems for a very long time.  Currently, **I need to take 7.5mg of zolpidem with 25mg of promethazine (an antihistamine drug) every night, to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep.** I also take valerian (800mg), melatonin (6mg), CBN oil every night, however, they work more or less like a placebo in my case.

The combination of zolpidem with promethazine usually works, but not always. And sometimes, even after 8 hours of sleep, I feel like I wasn't sleeping at all! In the morning, I feel sleepy, cold, tired, exhausted,  irritated, and my eyes are tired (with pressure like feeling) .... but I can't go back to sleep, or take a nap(during the day), I won't fall asleep even when I am exhausted! Other days it's more or less okay.

**Can you please help me to figure out, if those fatigue and exhaustion effects are associated with zolpidem or promethazine? Is there even a possibility that melatonin could be the cause?** 

It won't happen every night, but at least once or twice per week (it's unpredictable). Usually, when I keep waking up several times in the morning, I know for sure I will be exhausted for the rest of the day (even If I slept for 9 hours in total on that night).

In the past, my psychiatrist gave me a prescription for quetiapine 12.5 -25mg for sleep support (PRN use). I took it twice and I didn't like it at all! It made me feel groggy, drowsy, and confused for the whole next day. Trazodone didn't help with sleep, and it gave me the next-day side effects. Mirtazapine knocked me out, but I slept for 12 hours straight and I gained a lot of weight on this medication (even while I was on the lowest/starting dosage).

I am trying to get off zolpidem or at least reduce the dosage to a half. I know it's not healthy at all, especially taking it every night. In the past, my sleep problems were even worse, so I am glad that nowadays I am able to get some sleep for most of the days, even with the help of zolpidem.

From r/insomnia I can see that CBD oil is not a guaranteed sleep enhancer, at least not directly - though it's purported anxiety alleviating properties might help indirectly with rest, lower cortisol levels etc.

I've taken 25mg seroquel nightly for years until I switched to zolpidem. I drink 0,5l black coffee daily, but not after 1 pm. I have my last meal at 6 pm.

29,"Only one sleeping med works for me TLDR at bottom but please only reply if you read the novel (post) below as otherwise I'll probably get replies about sleep studies or lavender tea.   


And it's one I really don't like being on - Seroquel.

Insomnia started when I went on Nardi for severe depression (have been on pretty much every type of antidepressant going over the last couple of decades - the only ones that worked were fluoxetine the first time I was prescribed it but it stopped working and has never worked since and Ketamine infusions - magic for a while but these days no effect).

Nardil was amazing at first, antidepressant wise. Right now it's probably helping but nothing like in the early months. I've been on it about 18 months.

The insomnia with Nardil has been severe. When I started Nardil I was already on Seroquel and was getting maybe 5 hours sleep, which I could handle. However more recently (couple of months ago) I came off Seroquel because I had put on weight and blamed Seroquel rather than my own gluttony and because the same dose was now giving me 3 hours sleep a night.

Came off Seroquel and had total insomnia for a few days. I was determined not to take any sleep meds just because the insomnia coming off Seroquel was so terrible, it wasn't something I wanted to go through more than once with another med. I thought if I could just get through it then natural sleep couldn't be much worse than 3 hours a night.

I was wrong. Even a month after coming off Seroquel I was having many nights of zero sleep and the other nights would be one or two hours. There were days I would fall asleep in the afternoon though. I also gained MORE weight because i was awake all night and not eating after dinner is easy enough if you're going to sleep at midnight and sleeping 8 hours but not so easy when you're awake all night.

I've tried Benzos, Z-drugs (both zopiclone and just last night 10mg zolpidem), DPH, Melatonin and all kinds of OTC supplements. My doc won't prescribe Trazodone because he's concerned about serotonin toxicity (there are articles disputing that but he still won't prescribe). Mirtazapine never helped me for sleep anyway and again, there's a 'serious' interaction possibility. Some of these drugs would help me get to sleep but I'd wake up after a couple of hours max. 

Seroquel - now I seem to need significantly more than the 25mg I was taking previously. In spite of all the 'less is more' when it comes to sleep stuff, that isn't true in my case. 300mg knocks me unconscious for 12 hours. Right now I'm just trying to find the right dose and guess it's going to be somewhere around 100mg. I know lots of people take that much and more. Still, I'm worried about becoming tolerant to its effects.

I should say I exercise 6 days a week, practice good sleep hygiene and am not stressed out or anything (I'm starting to become stressed about the lack of sleep but if I take the right drug I can fall asleep, i just can't stay asleep so I have the sleep maintenance type insomnia).

I could come off Nardil. It certainly triggered this (I have a medical history which means I'm always going to have to get up several times a night no matter what - will spare you the details - but I could always go right back to sleep) but I have two concerns with that: (i) that the insomnia now has a life of its own and coming off Nardil won't help; (ii) that unmedicated the depression is completely unmanageable and the most realistic option in terms of a med that may help is Parnate, which has an even worse profile for insomnia than Nardil does. 

I feel sort of scared that I'm down to ONE drug that can help me sleep. I had hoped to cycle meds. I feel that something like Ambien may work but I'd have to take more than 10mg which is the max prescribed dose. Possibly above 10mg isn't helpful for sleep anyway, you just end up doing a bunch of crazy stuff. 

I guess my only choice is to stick with the Seroquel and take whatever dose works. I just wondered if anybody else had any suggestions at all. I have talked with my doc but he hasn't really been helpful with this. He actually suggested CBT with a pal of his (referral fees, yay!) but I kind of feel that, for insomnia caused by a medication (Nardil) that's a bit like giving somebody meth then trying to get them to sleep using cognitive behavioural therapy. Of course it won't work because the drug causing the insomnia is massively overpowered compared to the benefit of any kind of therapy. I'm not saying Nardil is meth but there do seem to be some meth users that get better natural sleep than I do.   


TLDR: On an antidepressant where naturally I either don't sleep or sleep 1-2 hours a night. Tried pretty much everything to sleep that isn't contraindicated with Nardil. Only Seroquel works but at much higher doses than the 'typical' 25mg. Feel panicked that if Seroquel stops working or I get tolerant then I'm completely screwed. Also worried about long term Seroquel side effects (in particular tardive dyskinesia and akathisia). I'm probably just fucked but would appreciate any advice that doesn't involve lavender tea or warm baths, etc.",Zolpidem

31,"Is the US the worst country to suffer from chronic insomnia in? I think it's crazy that if you are a person who suffers frequent bouts of insomnia, due working shifts, aging, life stressors, you must go to get a prescription for medicines that are easily available at the pharmacy in other countries.

The only reason I can think of is the fact that health insurance rules just about every aspect of anything medically related in this awful country.

It sucks.

I've stayed in Mexico for extended periods and I can walk into the farmacia and  get some zolpidem and enjoy a restful night.

Here, in the US?  I must prove to my doctor ten thousand different things, try ten thousand different 'easy to prescribe' drugs; drugs that *don't* work btw.

It's the only thing that seems to work well?"" 

Good God Almighty!  One would have thought I asked him to prescribe me legal heroin! Right now I am on rozeram (?); that works like shit. 

I have tried several other drugs over the past 10-12 months and nothing, I mean nothing works except for those z drugs and anti anxiety meds like ativan, valium or xanax.  NONE of which my doctor seems to want to prescribe.  If I say the lack of sleep is making me depressed and suicidal the doctor right away wants to put me on antidepressants and see a psychiatrist!

Dude, just give me some sleeping pills.  I shouldn't be thinking about moving to a totally different *country* just to be able to sleep at night!

It's about 5 hours out from bedtime and I'm already making myself  anxious knowing I'm going to be up all night sick from those useless pills I am currently prescribed.

32,"Ambien (Zolpidem) withdrawal, thoughts? I have taken 2.5-5mg of Zolpidem around 3-7 nights a week off and on for about 5 years. Rarely going over that dose and have stopped for 3-10 days many times. 

I stopped taking them 9 nights ago, I'm actually getting some okay sleep not that much worse, but what I think is withdrawals is extremely odd and unpleasant on this occasion. Dizzy, foggy head, anxiety, the first few days weirdly I kind of slept loads, falling asleep very very early. It's been 10 days now, I'm barely feeling any better at all, I'm trying to remember what motivated me to try and stop.

35,"Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety and tons of drugs Hello, I have a close friend in another country who needs some help that he’s not getting at home.  His medical problems started about seven years ago with insomnia which snowballed into myriad other afflictions, many of them side-effects of the medications: depression, anxiety, muscle pain/weakness, persistent nausea/vomiting, total lack of appetite, ED and suicidal ideation.  He and his doctors have tried an astonishing array of drugs (detailed below) but have made no progress in treating his insomnia and the other problems reduce his quality of life to near-zero.  To complicate things further, an unfortunate family situation routinely serves to make things worse.

&#x200B;

I’m posting here today because we’re hoping to find: 

\- medical professionals who don’t believe that the answer is “more drugs”

\- other individuals struggling, recovering or recovered from similar circumstances

\- recommended courses of action

\- facilities or support organizations with relevant expertise 

&#x200B;

As his friend, I believe that his doctors at home (in a country with public healthcare) have neither the resources nor the incentives to make him better, and so their efforts to medicate him are more about stabilization than recovery.  In other words, I believe that his doctors have basically given up.  I will not.  We eagerly welcome anything positive that this community has to offer.  Thank you.

I heard great things about Dayvigo, the clinical studies shows that people who went off it didn't experience any withdrawals, and a high percentage of people said it helped them sleep so it looked promising. So I asked my doctor to prescribe it to me and she did, but then  I learned that because the drug is so new my insurance (bluecross blueshield) doesn't cover it, so they switched it to Zolpidem for some reason. Don't know why exactly that drug, in instances like these they're supposed to switch it to something thats the equivalent, but I guess not. I dont think my doctor even knows lol, she didn't want to start me on benzoyl. 

So I just said fuck it might as well pick it up and try it out. Its 5mg, and I've taken it 4 times now over the course of 2 weeks. It hasn't helped me fall or stay asleep. I take it right at bedtime, I don't feel any kind of effects, still takes me 4 plus hours to fall asleep. Last night I decided to take 2 pills, one at 11pm, then I took another at 3am because I was still awake, and that still didn't work. My body is so fucked.

You could have sex, drive, buy a car at a 24 hour dealership or die and not even know it. It rarely happens with zaleplon and thats normally only in the 20mg dose(it's only happen to me once in 1 1/2 years). You can get prescribed two a night. Incase you have the problem of when you wake up you can go back to sleep. Zolpidem can cause a hangover. It shouldn't be inpossible to get a hangover on Zaleplon as its half life is only a hour.

40,"Girlfriend can't fall asleep even on multiple high dose medications So I wanna preface this by mentioning that the person I am referring to in this post suffers from multiple psychological disorders. She is also medicated for some of these outside of the medications she takes to help her sleep.

I thought it might be a good idea to just list them off right away as well as what medications she takes for said disorders.

- Bipolar Type 1 (Lithium & Lamictal/Lamotrigine)

- BPD

- Undiagnosed Psychosis Disorder, most likely Schizophrenia (Olanzapine)

- Complex PTSD

- GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder)

With that out of the way, she has had trouble sleeping basically all her life, but it has gotten worse during the last year or so. 

Last night she fell asleep around 4AM after having taken multiple sleep medications as prescribed by her doctor at around 10-11PM. 

Her sleep medications are:

- Quetiapine (Seroquel) [200mg]

- Trimeprazine [80mg]

- Zolpidem (Ambien) [10mg]

Even with all those three, taken combined, are not enough to make her fall asleep. 

She has also tried a bunch of other sleep medications with little or no success. 
Here is a list of other sleep medications she has tried:

- Propiomazine

- Promethazine

- Hydroxyzine

- Zopiclone

- Melatonin

- Risperidone (Risperdal)

[All of these have been tried at multiple dosages]

At this point she doesn't really know what to try next or if there is even any point to trying anything else since nothing seems to be working.
Has anyone else here had similar experiences to her? If so did you ever find a medication that did work? If not did any life-style changes help in any way? Have you found anything at all that slightly helps?

I have trouble falling asleep and wake up frequently throughout the night I also have very vivid bad dreams every time I go to sleep. This means I’m having around 3-5 bad dreams every night. 

I don’t have pristine sleep hygiene but I do try. 

Currently in remission for depression and still taking antidepressants.

Ive given a fair shot to herbal/natural remedies like chamomile, melatonin and valerian, but they don’t work for me.

I think I've finally reached the end of the road with my current meds.  I'm on Temazepam 30mg and have been taking it for about a year and a half now.  Out of the 7 different prescription meds I've taken, this one was the best.  But now I can take a handful and it doesn't do a thing.

I've taken everything and I have no idea what to even suggest to my doc.  Ambien, Trazadone, zolpidem, lunesta, doxepin, sonata, and currently Temazepam.  Some of the meds gave me horrible side effects, some just flat out didn't work.

And I know this is the insomnia group so we all get each other but I always like to mention this for the newbies - Yes, I sleep in a comfortable room.  Yes, I have nice pillows.  No, I dont watch tv or use electronics in bed.  Yes, I've tried melatonin.  Yes, I crank the air so everything is nice and cold.  Yes, it's dark. No, I don't drink caffeine too late.",Zolpidem
47,"Weaning off sleeping meds So my insomnia started back in April (if I recall correctly) and I immediately started using sleeping pills. Basically at least half a pill of Doxylamine daily, sometimes a Zolpidem but I tried to only use it when I had to cause I know you quickly build tolerances to it.

This worked for awhile, but starting last week I started having major sleep problems even with sleeping meds. I tried switching to Diphenhydramine instead of Doxylamine in hopes that maybe I had developed a tolerance to Doxylamine and maybe using something else would work but it really didn't make a difference. So I started to consider the idea that what I'd heard about taking sleeping pills for too long was true and that it was doing more harm than good.

So, I cut myself off and while my sleep has still been bad, it's actually been a little better than it had been. What I've found though is my dreams since I stopped taking sleeping pills have been incredibly vivid and overwhelming to the point the dreams are actually waking me up. Is this a common side-effect others have encountered when cutting off sleeping pills. I mean, overall I'm somewhat optimistic that my sleep has actually improved somewhat since stopping the pills, but man, the dreams/nightmares have really been something else.",Zolpidem

Fast-forward to tonight, and it's looking like I may be in for a similar kind of evening. I have been trying for almost an hour and a half to sleep.

Not sure what I did wrong there- kinda mad that I blew $50 on the stuff. I feel relaxed, but when I am in bed, I am just breathing deeply for hours on end while being awake.

49,"Should I find a new GP? sche​

I had called my regular doctors office ***last week*** when I was at day 5 of probably 3 hours total sleep (total in 5 days) and left a message (of course) about prescribing something for sleep.

Apparently there is nothing else they can do and want me to come in to see the doctor...three months from now is their earliest convenient time!

They have exhausted all meds they can prescribe for me, which as far as I can tell are TWO (trazadon-3 years ago & some kind of anticholinergic - couple of  months ago). One made me sick, one made me sick AND suicidal...BOTH gave me headaches.

I am allergic to Zolpidem (from trying 25 years ago-skin irritation) so they said Lunesta is out of question, even though lunesta works fine for me?

I currently don't have insurance so I will have to be paying out of pocket for additional dr appointments and meds. I have been seeing this doctor for 10 years. I live in a tiny town and although there a quite a few specialists, dr's accepting new patients are really really hard to find but I'm thinking maybe I *should*?

I've started resorting to drinking before night time these past couple of days which I absolutely hate because I am (also) allergic to most alcohols except beer which tastes terrible to me but at least I can pass out for a few hours , even if the hangovers are not worth it. I'm afraid I will turn into an alcoholic eventually, all because the damn doctor thinks I'm being over dramatic about my sleep issues.

I'm so sad no doctor will actually listen to me and either wants to put me on anti-depressants all of which have terrible side effects(psych doc) or just refuses to help (gp)

TL;DR: regular doctor won't prescribe anything for sleep and psych doc just thinks I'm depressed (which I guess I am...because I DON""T SLEEP!).

edit:  I think I will start looking for a new doctor.  I always harken back to the seinfeld episode where elaine is dubbed ""difficult"" and I'm afraid mine will say ""seeking pills"", lol.

64,"Strange experience with Ambien? Hi guys, just asking out of curiosity, don't really need any advice. I've read a number of stories on Reddit of people taking Ambien/zolpidem and having strange things happen to them afterwards, like waking up in a car without knowing how they'd got in there, or sleepwalking and doing some dangerous stuff. I remember there was an episode about it in Big Little Lies and I remember having seen it somewhere else as well.

The strange thing is the only such stories I've heard come from Americans (or at least I think so since these stories always specicifally mention ""Ambien"", not any other medicine based on zolpidem). 

I am myself a horrible insomniac and have been taking zolpidem occasionally for years and have never experienced a situation like this (the worst thing is that I am dizzy the next day and I'm worried I might get addicted to it) nor have I heard of anything like this from any of my European friends. Whenever a doctor prescribes zolpidem to me, they always mention how addictive it is and such but never do they mention that I might ""lose control of myself"".

66,"Rx advice? I finally met with a Psychiatrist and we talked all the meds for anxiety and insomnia. She gave me three different pills to try: 
Gabapentin (Neurontin)
Quetiapine (nervous to try? Doesn’t seem great in reviews)
Zolpidem (Ambien) 

I’m pretty excited to potentially sleep for a change. What’s been your experience with these? Asking because I’m inclined to only try ambien and feel weird having three to choose from here. Haven’t taken any as I’m waiting for the weekend to avoid additional grogginess at work.

Edit:
5mg of Ambien generic didn’t work, sigh. I woke up around 2 am as usual and the thoughts just wouldn’t stop. However I felt relaxed and not so anxious, just lots of brain chatter.
Two nights later I tried 10 mg and made a huge difference. I slept hard, woke a few times but went right back to sleep (this is life changing already!). I did wake up too early, around 5 am but feeling pretty rested! Not going to take tonight so I can rely only when needed.",Zolpidem
67,"Is there a similar antihistamine to Promethazine, but with a shorter half-life? Hi, I am taking this medication every night for sleep problems in combination with zolpidem(to fall asleep and to stay asleep at night). Since I need to take it every night, I have already built up a tolerance and 25mg (1 pill) is not working anymore. My doctor recommended me to take 50mg, but he noticed that I may feel drowsy and dull the next day until afternoon. Later, I checked the half-life of this medication and it says 16-19 hours.  

I keep wondering, is there the same medication as promethazine (or even better one) but with a shorter half-life?

Before I have tried trazodone and low doses of Seroquel, but I didn't like any of them. Trazodone didn't work and Seroquel gave me unpleasant side effects for the next day, which outweighed the benefit of the drug.

68,"Best alternative to zopiclone? I recently moved to the US from Canada and it's  been fine but they don't prescribe Zopiclone in this country.

I've tried zolpidem (less effective) and mirtzapine (not effective), and I haven't slept properly and I'm throwing off my day.

To be fair I have been trying to get off sleeping pills entirely, I'm certain it can't be good in the long run.  It's a big challenge however, I spend a couple nights up last week with out it.

70,"Advice for Chronic Fatigue / Insomnia ? I'm writing to inquire about how to go about some of my sleep issues I've had for roughly 10+ years and now that I'm 25 coming up soon I just can't function like I used to. Getting the worse side effects lately. Memory loss, impatient, irritated easily, clumsiness, off balance, slur words in sentences at times, and overall an extremely overwhelming feeling of ALWAYS being tired.

I've done a home sleep test to rule out sleep apnea and bloodwork many times to check if all my tests were normal and they are. I try going to bed same time most nights.

I've recently tried Temazepam 7.5 mg and that worked for sleeping 5 hours straight and I was happy enough with it but since it didn't quite reach 6+ I asked for maybe a stronger dosage. They doubled it to 15mg and that didn't even remotely make me feel tired anymore. I was so confused. 

Now I'm trying Ambien generic version zolpidem for 5mg (not the extended release version) and it made me drowsy quickly and I fell asleep just fine. Now only issue is I only slept 2 hours before waking up. Then I would eventually fall asleep again but wake up and repeat 4 times over the next 2 hours. And now as I write this I am still awake after taking my pill. Total sleep is around 3.5 hours max. 

I've tried pairing both temazapam and ambien with these hemp extract gummies people swore made them sleepy, no effect. 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Should I get zolpidem CR for extended release and if so should I try 10mg instead of the 5mg which wasn't working well?  OR should I just bite the bullet and find some sort of sleep specialist of center?

I have been feeling extremely fatigued lately and have little to no motivation to work when this sleepy always. I don't want to lose or quit my job because of it. What can I possibly do anyone?",Zolpidem
71,"Ultimate Guide to curing insomnia While there is no one magic bullet to cure insomnia and pills probably do more harm than good in the long run, there are some things you can do that significantly help. The cornerstone to healthy sleep is having a routine where you go to sleep at the same time each day. Other techniques, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia(CBT-I), can be more effective than most prescription medicines.

The following are tips and tricks I’ve picked up over the years from books or other decent sources(I’ve noted where I’m speculating, and it should be obvious where it’s a personal preference). It’s best to have a similar routine every day of the week, including weekends. I’ve framed it in the form of an example day, so the tips and timings may vary depending on you and your circumstances. You don’t need to do everything, but I guarantee that following the routine for a week will help even with the worst cases of insomnia. Of course, discuss everything with your doctor first.

Morning

06:30: I’ve woken up, feel rested, have had enough sleep, so it’s time to get up. (I diverge from the standard advice to use an alarm to wake up at the same time each day). So how much sleep is enough?
* I don’t worry too much about how much sleep I get in the short term; while the amount of sleep you get is very important, it can be counterproductive and create unnecessary stress worrying about it.
* I force myself to stay in bed for at least 4.5 hours before getting up.
* I aim to get at least 7-9+ hours of sleep. I don’t worry too much about sleeping too much(Studies showing correlations between sleeping for 12+ hours and worse health outcomes are probably an example of reverse causation where ill people need to sleep more). So I mainly listen to my body and sleep for as long I need.
* When you sleep, the space between your neurons expands so your body can wash away plaques associated with dementia. Studies also show that people who sleep longer are less likely to get dementia. So some experts believe that sleeping less than the standard 7-8 hours puts you at a higher risk of getting dementia.
* If you are consistently sleeping for only 4 hours or over 12 hours, then maybe see a doctor since that may be due to an underlying condition.
* The actual amount of sleep you need depends on what you did that day. If you worked out and did a lot of manual labour, you might need 11 hours of sleep, on the other hand, if you just spent it in front of Netflix you might only need eight hours of sleep.
* It’s going to be hard/impossible to work out exactly how much sleep you need and time it at the end of a sleep cycle, but you have a built-in alarm clock which will wake you up when you’ve had enough sleep.
* If you are still sleeping, then almost by definition, you need more sleep, so you shouldn’t use an alarm to wake up.
* You want to wake up naturally at the end of a sleep cycle; having an alarm wake you up in the middle of a sleep cycle can have various negate effects like making you feel tired and worn out when you wake up.
* Alarms are very stressful on your body; I never use the snooze button since it just puts your body under a high level of stress multiple times. Sure you can use one as a backup or let you know it’s time to get out of bed.
* So I think it’s best to go to sleep at the same time each day(that includes weekends and holidays), then waking up naturally once you’ve had enough sleep.

06:45: Go for a 45min jog outside. This is important for two key reasons, blue-light exposure and exercise.
* Once you’ve woken up, you want to expose yourself to sunlight. Your eyes have different receptors for the blue light that are used to calibrate your circadian rhythm. You ideally want to go outside since you get much more blue light exposure outdoors on an overcast day than indoors with bright lights.
* Exercise is important for general health and sleep.
* Studies show that for sleep, the best time to exercise is in the morning. Exercising at night can negatively impact sleep.

08:00: I have some vitamin D with breakfast. (I’m not confident that vitamin D helps with sleep, but most people don’t get enough sun exposure and are vitamin D deficient, which has many negative health impacts like making you more vulnerable to COVID).

Afternoon

12:00: Make a mental note to stop consuming any caffeine after mid-day.
* The build-up of adenosine makes you sleepy. Caffeine blocks the cell receptors that adenosine uses hence stops you from getting sleepy.
* Caffeine has a half like of 8 hours, so having it even in the late afternoon can impact sleep. Depending on your DNA, you may consume caffeine later in the day or need to avoid caffeine altogether.

Evening

19:00: Limit exposure to blue light.
* I make sure my (Hue) lights are dimmed and set to a yellow/red hue to limit blue light exposure.
* Try to avoid using computers, tablets or phones. But of course, I just need my Reddit fix, so I also use night mode or a blue light filter like f.lux.
* Use blue light filter glasses if needed.

19:00: Make a mental note to stop drinking alcohol.
* While alcohol has a depressant effect on your brain(that’s not sleep), it negatively impacts REM and deep sleep. It also has a rebound effect when it wears off.
* If you want to drink, the best time is in the morning to make sure it’s entirely out of your system when you go to sleep.

Sleep aids

20:30: Take some ZMA (Zinc Magnesium B6) and 3g glycine. Most supplements have limited evidence of efficacy, and most drugs/medicines probably don’t actually help with “sleep” and shouldn’t be taken long term.
* Melatonin. I think there is some evidence of this helping older adults or if you are jet-lagged. But I wouldn’t use it regularly; who knows what it does to your normal Melatonin production?
* Most drugs used to help with sleep, like alcohol, zolpidem (Ambien), zopiclone, etc., are depressants and help make you unconscious, which is kind of the complete opposite state your brain is in when you are sleeping. (There are some sleep stages where your brain is more active than when you are awake.)
* So if you take a drug and are unconscious for 12 hours, you may still find your self sleepy since some of that time would be “poor” quality sleep if it counts as sleep at all. There may also be lingering depressant effects after you wake up.
* While I would never use a drug long term to help with sleep, there may be occasions where I’d discuss short term use with my doctor.
* One of the first classes of sleep aids used are anti-histamines like Promethazine. You can usually get them without needing a prescription.
* Minor tranquilizers, benzos, z-drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone should probably only be used short term. There are so many downsides and likely negatively impact your quality of sleep.
* Major tranquilizers like quetiapine and olanzapine are typically used to treat conditions like schizophrenia and will knock you out(maybe not in the right way). It is thought that in low doses, they act as anti-histamines making you drowsy. Doctors probably shouldn’t be prescribing these for insomnia. The drug companies behind them have been fined millions for pushing off-label use to treat insomnia (and hundreds of millions more related to the dangers of the side effects).
I avoid using medicines and only consider them a short-term last resort after discussions with a doctor. (Many doctors use medications as a first-line, long term treatment for insomnia… so I think everyone should do some research before seeing a doctor)

20:30: Make a mental note to stop eating anything heavy.
* A heavy meal close to bed can interfere with sleep.

20:45: Have a nice hot bath and turn down the thermostat.
* One cue to your body that it’s time to sleep is a drop in temperature, both the environment’s and your body’s. So turn down the heating in the evening, open a window, etc.
* Paradoxically a hot bath can help since a hot bath causes vasodilation, which causes a drop in body temperature once you get out.

21:15: Have a nighttime herbal tea(caffeine-free) and do something relaxing like reading. (I’m not sure how strong the evidence is that tea helps)

21:30: Get into bed under a single bamboo flat sheet in a dark room. Set the alarm for 08:00. Turn on sleep tracking.
* Bamboo sheets are smooth, light and breathable. I think they are better than cotton/silk.
* I start with a simple flat sheet to help cool my body. I then use a thicker/heavier blanket if I’m still cold after a few minutes. (Some people sleep better with a heavy blanket).
* You want your room to be pitch black, try and turn off/remove any lights/LEDs from your bedroom.
* Get into bed at the same time each day. (An half an hour range may be better and more flexible)
* Choose a time to go to sleep so that I can wake up naturally without needing an alarm.
* Set the alarm as a backup giving me 10 hours of sleep, which usually is more than enough.
* Sleep tracking apps on your phone/watch can be useful. You shouldn’t get obsessed and look at them in detail every night, but they can help on occasions.
* You might not think you got any sleep, but a sleep tracking app can show you that actually you got way more sleep than you thought.
* One major cause of sleep issues is sleep apnea. Some apps can monitor snoring, and you can use that to help hear if you stop breathing or having other breathing issues at night.

21:35: Sleep meditation. Typically something from calm or headspace, it’s usually something like:
* Clear your mind and concentrate on breathing.
* Do a body scan, so concentrate on your feet, on an out-breath relax your feet, then move onto your lower legs, etc. Once you get to your head, your whole body should be relaxed. Then just concentrate on breathing in and out till you fall asleep.

Nighttime awakenings

11:58: I wake up. I ask alexa what time it is. (This avoids bright light exposure of looking at my phone or any other bright LCD/led screen). I go back to sleep.

02:00: I wake up. I know I should go back to sleep but can’t. I get up for half an hour and do something relaxing, like listening to a podcast and then try to go back to sleep. (This is speculative advice)
* I don’t think it’s good to have a polyphasic sleep pattern, like sleeping for 4 hours, being awake for 1 hour then sleeping for another 4 hours. But there are occasions when I’m restless in bed and can’t get back to sleep, where it helps.

06:30: I’ve woken up, feel rested, have had enough sleep, so it’s time to get up. REPEAT

Insomnia

One major issue with insomnia is that sometimes you associate your bed with sleeplessness rather than sleep. To help resolve this in the short term, you can use sleep restriction. The idea is to restrict the amount you sleep, so you are soo tired that you actually sleep when you are in bed. The way I do it is to go to sleep at the same time each day, but set my alarm to wake me up after 5 hours. I then slowly increase the time and eventually get rid of the alarm.

If you have insomnia, you should see a doctor. Here are some things to keep in mind/discuss with them.
* Get a blood test; are you low on any minerals or vitamins, etc.?
* Get a sleep study to try and identify any underlying issues?
* Get proper CBT-I/therapy to help.
* Do you have any other disorders like bipolar which are impacting your sleep?
* Discuss the benefits, risks, dangers, addiction potential of any potential sleep medicines.

72,"What are your experiences with zolpidem VS quetiapine (low-dose) for sleep? Hi, I have been having problems with sleep for the past several years. I also struggle with generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and depression. For the past 15 years, I have tried numerous different psychiatric medications, and over that time, I've developed insomnia and sleep problems. 

For the past 1-2 years, I have been taking zolpidem 7.5mg in combination with promethazine 25mg (antihistamine drug) almost every night, to be able to fall asleep and to stay asleep ( however it's not working for every night at all). 

Instead of zolpidem, I have tried trazodone (50 - 100mg), which didn't work and didn't sit well with me. It made me feel dizzy, light-headed, and foggy the next day. I also woke up during the night and I wasn't able to fall asleep again. In the past, I tried mirtazapine which I have found helpful for sleep, however, I slept for 12 hours straight on it and I couldn't tolerate side effects (such as the next day drowsiness and especially weight gain) even on the lowest dosage. With zolpidem, I can wake up the next day, drink coffee, and I am ready to go. With those two other drugs (trazodone, mirtazapine) I am dizzy, drowsy, brain fogged, and confused the next day.

Recently my doctor prescribed me quetiapine 25mg for sleep support. Since I had negative experiences with trazodone and mirtazapine, I am not very keen on trying this one.  

Can you please tell, what are your experiences with quetiapine 25mg and how would you compare it to zolpidem in terms of the next day side effects?

Hopefully thing would be better. Always seemed not be able to have proper sleep schedule. I remember being in high school and staying awake till morning. Due to not feeling sleepy, i would give fault to playing video games and computers. But it might actually have been otherway around, because i couldn't sleep I have been sitting on computer all night.

Then i became student at University and all I remember now is doing all nighter doing group assignments by myself. Because I was the one who always did the assignment, I remember people even asking to be in the same group with me. Didn't think much but I might have pulled 3-4 all nighters a week. 

Started working after I graduated and the job I did required me to wake up at 2-3 in the morning or go to bed after midnight usually. It was really tiring but I was able to continue doing it, kinda.
Usually I don't have double eyelid but I developed double eyelid in my left eye, that didn't disappear until now. Sometimes when I have been exhausted for a while my right eyelid would become double eyelidded and that was sign for me to know that I was tired. I jokingly told my friends how I have innate ability to tell my tiredness level due to my eyelid.

Then I started having sudden bouts of irrational anger issues and major depression. I quit my job for a while ago and have been really depressed since. I started staying in bed every night, obsessing over all the little mistakes I made and would be guilt stricken about them.

At some times, I knew I wasn't being able to be functional adult, I still am not but hopefully that changes soon. 

My mind seemed not to rest. Constantly racing and thoughts would just come in like river stream.
I would obsess over ecery little bad things I did since I was a kid and guilt myself over it. It became so unbearable I even contacted some childhood friends I haven't contacted in a decade and apologized for the wrongs I did to them. Most of them had forgotten about that even but accepted it nonetheless. I read philosophy books a lot and thought probably I was having existential crisis or feelings angst. But I think I was just having depression symptoms.

Everyday, I would tell myself 'just one good nights sleep and then if you keep that good nights sleep for several other nights and regain your lost circadian rhythm' all will be fine. So since last winter i have been doing everything to get back my sleep schedule.

Finally last December, I decided to get medical help. But it wasn't easy. It took me a week to get to the hospital because sometimes I would't sleep and be so tired or sometimes when I sleep i would oversleep and miss the time to go to hospital.

I got to the hospital finally and had conversations with doctors and they recommended me to go to a therapist for my mental health but due to covid I am unable to find any therapist where I live.
But also i was prescribed Alprozam, Diazepam for 10 days each but they had absolutely no effect on me. 

I have been taking Zolpidem for 2 weeks now and I am able to sleep for a few hours each night now. 
But when I take it and sleep at 10-11pm. I am waking up exactly at 3am.

Is it expected? Doctor says that I also have Sleep-maintenance insomnia. So today prescribed me another drug to take if I wake up midnight.

Also do everyone's lower back hurt really bad everyday? I been wondering if it is due to my lack of sleep or is there any other problem?


I lost several years of my life struggling to have a good nights sleep. I don't even know what it feels like to wake up in the morning like in the movies. My wake up is always full of neck, lower back and head pain.  Hopefully things change for the better.

**Any advice would be really appreciated.** 

TLDR: Always had problem with sleep. Have been convincing myself that it is just due to my bad life style and kept telling myself that just few good nights sleep would straighten things out. It didn't and now I am on medication and actually get 3-4 hours sleep consistently. Better than not being able to sleep, I guess.",Zolpidem
79,"Need some kind of sleeping medication due to chronic insomnia, but have run out of options for things to try, what medication options can I still try? (desperate and scared) To make a long story short, I've suffered with a sleep disorder for 15 years now. Despite immense amount of testing/studies, the experts aren't sure what I have, with the best guess being a type of the REM sleep behavior disorder. The one thing that was still going for me was I was able to fall asleep pretty much right away, that is, until a very traumatic event in Oct 2018. Since then I've suffered from worsening chronic insomnia, in addition to severe anxiety, depression, and stress due to many real life situations and being in a very bad spot in life for the past 2+ years.

Since the Oct 2018 event, I've needed sleep medication to get to sleep. Unfortunately things have worsened and the things that were at least kind of working no longer are, or have major side effects where I can't take them anymore. I don't know what to do or what to try anymore. Here's what I've tried (PS: I would have already tried marijuana if it was legal in WI, but it's not, thank you backwards ass government):

&#x200B;

* Ambien / Zolpidem IR and ER: I'm at the max 12.5 dosage and it only gets me slightly tired and lasts 3-4 max, I'm then wide awake
* Remrom / Mirtazapine: Had some effectiveness, but caused severe weight gain in a very short amount of time each time I tried it. I'm talking 10-15 pounds in 2-3 weeks. I couldn't fit into clothes I normally could anymore.
* Klonopin / Clonazepam: Also the 'gold standard' for REM sleep behavior disorder, but not effective for me. Had some insomnia effectiveness in the past, but recent trials on it caused me to have severe panic attacks. It also seems to have caused morning panic attack or restless leg syndrome in the past month where I wake up around 6 and can't get back to bed because I HAVE to move my legs.
* Catapres / Clonidine: Made me slightly groggy but didn't help me stay asleep. Recently it seems to actually have interrupted my REM sleep as it seemed I would wake up every time I was about to dream and continue having constant wakeups at night.
* Desyrel / Trazodone: Slightly worked but also had an allergic reaction to it even in relatively low doses which caused my nose to plug up and difficulty breathing.
* Seroquel / Quetiapine IR: Same issue as Trazodone only much more severe. Had issues at 100mg and the first night I took it at 200mg I nearly had to call an ambulance because it closed up my throat where I had to stay sitting up until started to wear off as otherwise I'd asphyxiate myself.
* Melatonin: Tried various mg amounts. Causes lots of weird dreams, but does almost nothing to get or stay asleep.
* Diphenhydramine: Apparently I'm one of those who it doesn't work on. Barely has any effect if at all.",Zolpidem

Since that day i took escitalopram, i’ve taken zolpidem 4 days separately, but i’m afraid i might become dependent.

The lack of sleep wreaks havoc on the mind and psyche; I vigilantly monitor my memory, balance, and coordination, fearing that I have the that unnamed neurodegenerative disorder.  I’ve seen my doctor — who has prescribed an SSRI and Zolpidem — and I think a sleep study is in order.

But I’m afraid.  Sleep has never, ever been this elusive or stressful.",Zolpidem
85,"Seroquel vs. Zolpidem(Ambien) Hi :)

Could you please help me decide which on is the best for sleep? How much Seroquel is equal to 10mg Zolpidem or what doses help you sleep?



I have been battling to sleep now for a few years and have been prescribed Zolpidem 10mg as needed(which is getting to every night) and Mirtazapine 15mg which works but not great.

I am going to the doctor tomorrow and thinking of getting him to switch my medication from Zolpidem 10mg, Mirtazapine to Seroquel but not sure if i should do that cause if he takes away my zolpidem and then i won't be able to sleep at all.

Please help which one is the best for you?",Zolpidem
86,"New. Hello all! I'd like to open a free discussion among us regarding withdrawel symps from common Rx'd solutions to counteract Insomnia: One are Benzodiazepins (ie. Valium, Cloneazepam, Alorazepam) the other subject is ""Z"" class sleep drugs (ie. Zopiclone aka Imovan Zolpidem aka Ambiem) To begin, a bit about myself.  I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 , AD\[H\]D, Depression, Anxiety, as well as Chronic Insomnia.

For Bipolar 2 I am medicated with 200mg Seroquel XR and Divalproex 500mg shortly before bedtime.

For AD\[H\]D I am medicated with 36mg \*brand name Concerta XR (aka IR Ritalin) In the Morning

For Depression I am medicated with 20mg Fluoxetine (Prozac) shortly before bed

For Anxiety I am medicated with 0.25mg Clonazepam in the morning

For Insomnia I am medicated with 0.5mg Clonazepam, 75mg Seroquel (IR) and 7.5mg Zopiclone -- my other night time meds are supposed to help with these two in getting me asleep

I know neither Z drugs or benzos should be taken for prolonged times, though that being said I have been on Zopiclone for atleast 4 years now at this moment.  Benzos I have been on for around years now.

&#x200B;

It has been a long time since i have had a medication change, and I am wondering if I should request a change.

Since this is an insomnia forum I will stick to those issues.

I have as of recently been having trouble and concerns regarding my medication.  I pose this question to you all, could my medication-tolerance finally caught up to me? My doctors have NOT increased ANY of my medication along the years.  I can clearly feel a difference in how they influence me now.

&#x200B;

The CLoneazepam is just a little too weak; It is a sedative but in my case its used to cease my anxiety before bed.

Zopiclone is the interesting one now.  And I am not quite sure how to word it appropiately but It feels as if I now ""feel like my self"" while on Zopiclone sometimes.  My mind during these periods are the only time I see my common actions as not trying as hard as i should at life. Sometimes the Zopiclone can make me feel like my old self before all of my mental issues.       it would appear to cure my anxiety and depression simutaniously and actually do enjoyable things.

\----------> Would I have a chance of asking for a revision of my medications from my psychiatrist?

\---------> Could there be a medication which could work similar to Zopiclone but not make the user drowsy?  One of my doctors has suggested Gabapentin in the past.

\------------> I know

\--------> I have infact tried both gabapentin and pregabelin before and both helped a bit (though I know finding ones which have good chemistry with you is difficult.

I am a recent Uni grad living back at home since April or so.  During covid I have just stayed home and helped my family ( a few of my family members are more at risk than average people) Though. All I am doing is collecting from Ontario Disability.  But I cant stand this stagnent lifestyle.  I'd so like to just overcome this depression or inbalence of chemicals in my brain.

I am I am almost ready to fully try to integrate back into society but If I cannot get a revisions of all my prescriptions , increases, decreases, etc etc. I know my self and I will just go right into the same slump eventually.

&#x200B;

Even if only one person comments here, I'd be really grateful.  I know my mind may seem all over the place right now but i am currently in the predicament of where me on my zopiclone actually makes me feel normal again.  And is just so difficult and hard to explain to my psychiatrist.  I know for a fact it is not proper to use Zopiclone during the day - so i always try not to, but it doesnt work at night all the time either.  IT used to put me asleep and keep me asleep, but now my sleep schedule has been whack, 6am > 4pm or 4am > 4pm.  I KNOW I am sleeping too much right now. I KNOW what I am doing is contratictory to getting good.

\------> My hope is this can be understood by others.  I havent been doing anything much ""valuable"" during when I am awake, I can't even think right I just do the same day in and out and THAT MUST STOP.  So YES I have been sleeping more hours now to atleast have some excitement and socializing, even if its only in a silly dream.

\-------> IS there a reason Z drugs , like benzos both go to GABA receptors, add the same effect?  If so I have veen on Benzos for nearly 6 years now with no medication upgrades to deal with growing tolorance to the drug.  I am a little worrried about this as I know even a year of benzos is NOT GOOD but 6 YEARS , now that really cant be good.

89,"Anxiety, insomnia and being an overachiever - the vicious cycle 22 year old female here. 

In the past 5 weeks I could only sleep with medication due to my anxiety. (Zolpidem) if i didn’t take it i would get zero to 2 hours of sleep max. Slowly i started decreasing the dose and found out it’s not the medication that makes me fall asleep - it’s the act of taking something, pshysically putting something in my body that I can rely on, if I can’t rely on myself anymore. So it’s probably all in my head. This weekend I tried not taking anything and not doing anything about sleep hygiene and finally I fell asleep within 10 minutes and slept through most of the night. (only woke up once or twice and got 7-8 hour’s of sleep). This confirmed that my sleep issues are caused by anxiety bc when I don’t have to do anything the next day I sleep better.

I had sleep issues in the past bc of generalized anxiety and sleep anxiety. It’s always related to school and not being able to perform well during the day. Funny thing is, I am in a program of classical singing so I have to use my whole body and be well rested. This past couple of weeks I felt like a failure, I couldn’t sing well and couldn’t study for the rest of my classes during the day. I’m kind of a perfectionist and it’s a constant cycle of negative experience. I missed classes bc of this bc I was so tired. When I go to bed I think I fall asleep but wake up every 30 minutes/1 hr in sweats and my heart racing. My doc prescribed me SSRI but I refused to take it yet. I don’t wanna be medicated, and I don’t feel depressed or anxious enough during the day to take it, only when it’s time to sleep. 

I recently started taking CBD oils, no results yet.

I guess i’m not asking for advice, just needed to vent. But if you have any feel free to say regardless.

96,"Is this normal? Hi,

Since I was a child I have problems falling sleep. When I go to bed I spend minimum 30min, normally 1h and sometimes 2 or 3h to fall asleep. I don't really know what a siesta is. Tried but never got to sleep.

The problem is that I must sleep at least 7h30min, better 8h. Otherwise the following day I can't focus properly, all day long feeling dizzy, the feeling is like having a swollen brain. This happens when I sleep less than 7h30.

I take melatonin. 4 pills each night. If I still can't, I take another 3. I have been doing this, this way, for years. When I didn't have melatonin it was nearly impossible, always 1h30, 2h maybe bored at bed. If I really can't sleep then I take zolpidem tartrate, 2.5mg (half a pill). I appreciate this pill really works, but I am scared of getting used to it so I just use it like once or twice a month. Sometimes more, sometimes less often. 

I am afraid of travelling, because whenever I travel away is like having to kill myself, being all day long feeling dizzy, grumpy...i always carry with me my pillow wherever I go, but I can't take it if I take a plane. The pillow helps, but it's not the same in any sense. 

I have eye problems and I have every screen very dimmed. So I don't use filters. My wife can't barely see anything on the screens I use. I also go to sleep every day at the same time and I try to get up at the same time, even on weekends. 

Sometimes I wonder if a circadian rhythm of for example 30h would fit me. For sure I would feel more tired. But responsibilities like work wouldn't let me try, among other things. 

The thing is that a lot of people feel like that, feeling that so bad but only sleeping 3 or 4h... Why do I feel so terrible all day long even sleeping 7h? Worse if I sleep less. But still is like throwing my entire day to the bin. Since I have memories this has been like that.

What do you think? Is this normal? What would you recommend? I live in Spain, 26M. I have checked with the doctor sometimes and it would simply give me pills. They help but I wouldn't like to take them all my life, for sure it will develop some other problem in the long run, along with addiction. Would you search somewhere else? I also read a book about a guy which was a football sleep trainer that recommended a lot of things..

I also have been using ear plugs for over 5 years. And wearing a night mask for over 10. Thankfully I sleep with an air conditioner so I can close the windows and the shutters so no light and no sound can disturb my sleep. Sometimes I drink a little of whiskey, I don't specially like it but sometimes it helps.

97,"inconsistent sleep hours, need to reset bodyclock ASAP hello, so a bit of background: i'm 22, and i need 8-9 hours of sleep to function properly. however, because i'm having my summer break my bodyclock's totally screwed. i've been sleeping around 2.30am-4am, more recently 4am, and i sleep from 4am-1pm.

have become a mess. I follow all the recommended sleep hygiene advise and do regular exercise.

100,"I've had insomnia for the past month I hope this is the right thread to vent in. I'm not sharing it with my friends and family anymore because they make an even bigger fuss about it and it makes me anxious. None of the experience insomnia so it's a big deal to them. 

I've read somewhere that chronic insomnia is when you don't sleep for 3-4 nights a few times a month (correct me if I'm wrong), and that would be my case atm. I didn't sleep for 4 nights 2 weeks ago, and while writing this, this is my 4th night going on again.

It had never been this severe before. I started experiencing insomnia 3 years ago. It would happen maybe 3 times a year. The longest I've gone without sleep is 5 nights. I was anxious the first two times it happened, but now I don't really panic about it. It was very severe 3 years ago. My anxiety was through the roof so I mainly blamed it on that. I would feel quite anxious and would get heart palpitations while trying to fall asleep. I went to the doctor then and I was prescribed benzos. They worked. I still struggle with anxiety but it's been okay since then.

I usually fall asleep around midnight-1AM. I don't stay up too late. I go to the gym usually (pre covid lifestyle). I avoid eating after 7PM. I don't have any health issues that I know of except for anxiety and depression. I feel pretty okay physically. I feel even better than I did 3 years ago.

Well the insomnia I've been experiencing for the past month is **nothing like before**. My anxiety is stable. My thoughts don't rush at night. No heart palpitations. I feel tired. I can sense when I'm ready to sleep. I tried chamomile tea and showering before bed, but nope. I've also had quite a few active days where I'd feel immensely tired, but by the time I was supposed to sleep, it didn't help. My brain is just unable to switch to a state of sleep.

I asked my mom if she had any sleeping pills on hand, as I'm unable to visit a doctor atm. I don't have any benzos on hand. It was a zolpidem drug brand. It made me paranoid and I had a really weird reaction. It did help me fall asleep but it was one of the weirdest experiences in my life.

I needed a place to vent but suggestions are welcome. I just need that one night of sleep in order to get my sleeping cycle back to normal.

102,"Success with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) **Summary**: I feel the need to talk about my experience with **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**. I have had insomnia for about 8 months (it's been hell) but now have been sleeping well with no aid for about 6 weeks after CBT therapy. Prior to trying it, I told myself I would make a post if it worked.

**Disclaimer**:

* Use this information to decide if you want to try CBT. There are books on how to do self-CBT but there's **A TON** of things that a Therapist or Psychiatrist will do better. Don't assume that I'm covering all the details.
* I'm not done my therapy and there are quite a few practices we haven't even tried yet and there are problems that I still haven't resolved yet. I still have bad nights once in a while.
* Everyone is different. Insomnia affects everyone differently and can be solved differently.
* Your primary doctor/physician should be your first point of information regarding sleep and medication.
* I’m writing this because I found that there is little information about CBT.
* I’m not here for critique or to judge others. Insomnia just really really sucks and I thought it was ruining my life. (Or that's how I felt)

## Quick description of my situation:

* **My Insomnia**: Main issue for me is falling asleep rather than keeping asleep (there is really two different types). For 8 months, I either got zero sleep, or 3 hours at 7am when the sun was coming up. My brain just can’t turn off sometimes. I over think things a lot and it won’t turn off.
* **Psychological Causes**: Depression and anxiety due to dissatisfaction at work, pathologizing sleep... I think. *I always felt that when I sleep well, I feel well. Or that a good day work had a direct correlation to how I slept the night before. Which is simply not true.*
* **Physical Causes**: Disrupted sleep due to loud neighbors, every other day I was changing houses by sleeping at my girlfriends, and due increased chemical dependence on drugs

## My experience:

So lately I have been seeing a CBT Sleep Specialist Psychiatrist. After my second or third appointment looking for more/different medication from my family doctor, he off-handily mentioned CBT as a highly successful alternative but didn’t push it very hard. Not sure if it was due to stigma with mental health or personal medical philosophy but we quickly moved on to the conversation of prescriptions and general sleep hygiene. Only on my 6th appointment, did I ask for a referral because I was starting ramp on my zoplicone dosage and felt that I needed to get serious about trying every option. I know medication works for a lot of people but I didn’t want to become dependent so early in life. After working at a pharmacy in the past, I saw people were dependent and it was scary when were out of stock and a customer was in desperate need of it for the very same night. So I asked for a referral and waited for my first appointment.

So enough background... there are some valuable things I worked on with my Psychiatrist.

1. Biggest and first thing was **breathing exercises**. And reducing heart rate. Like longer times breathing out. Shorting times breathing in. Practicing what ratio of time works best for me by using actual heart rate sensors. At home, I do it while watching a show before bed. If I start yawning, I take that as my queue to \~try to sleep\~. This is also useful for daily life when you're just stressed.
2. Ultimately, **removing my need for the ""perfect"" night**. By the end, I should be able to sleep without everything being perfect. Like the space and noise around you.
3. **Learning misconceptions** about basic sleep hygiene. A lot of the facts online apply to everyone differently. You got to learn what works for you.
4. **Being comfortable with less**. Like a consistent 5*6 hours nights rather than on*and*off 8*9 hours every day. Also not fighting a bad night. Letting myself live within it. Doing some remote work if I am really awake and cut my losses when I need to.
5. Learning **how I might be pathologizing sleep** is huge. Identifying why I feel the need to control my sleep. What are my fears.... What are my misconceptions? And asking myself if people can really tell when I'm tired and grumpy.
6. A **general analysis to understand why I am stressed**. Similar to pathologizing things but instead focusing on constructive ways of dealing with my problems. Essentially, if you are happier with life, you might sleep better.
7. Fully committing to be okay with a **lot of shitty nights** before it gets better. Especially if you are at risk of rebound insomnia from getting off drugs.
8. Taking coffee only between 10 am and 11:30 am. Or between 1:30pm and 3:00pm. Look online about **matching your cortisol levels with coffee**.

* NB: I actually like my Psychiatrist. Which is probably really important. I feel like I could easily cringe if I didn’t like them.

## CBT Therapy info:

* It was about a month between being referred and the first appointment.
* We talk for about 1.5-2 hours every 2-3 weeks
* Cost Upfront: $150-180
* My insurance: Covered \~70%(Only for psychiatrists not therapists). I understand it’s not suitable for everyone.

## Things that helped me outside of CBT:

* **Taking a break from sleeping is huge!** It might sound confusing, but it’s just like when you are stuck on a problem at work or school. If you are restless, get up and read a book, play a simple game. Try sleeping again later. The longer time you spend waiting to fall asleep. The longer you're dragging on the process of staying up.
   * **Don’t look at the clock if you can**. I used a Kasia smart plug to turn on a low\*light lamp at 1:30 to remind me that I've been waiting too long. If I fall asleep early, I don’t notice it anyway.
   * \*\*Reverse psychology.\*\*Plan stuff to do like shaving your face or folding clothes. Eventually you don't bother getting up do it anyway because your brain will want to do the opposite and you'll feel tired.
* **Journaling** good and bad nights, and days when I decided to medicate (+dosage) helped a ton.
   * Losing memory from lack of sleep really sucked. It helped me feel a little more in control and track my progress.
   * It was good for finding triggers that caused my insomnia too.
   * It was also useful when talking to my family doctor about getting prescriptions (gives on objective view)
* **Not giving a shit about blue light.**
   * There are so many factors to consider. Watching a to show or playing Skyrim at 2am relaxes me way more than the downside of blue light on my brain.
* **Making a plan during the day**, and sticking to it during the night to avoid emotionally driven decisions. Making fear based decisions causes habits and addictions.
* **Trying only one solution every two weeks.** Dont complicate your results with multiple things going on at once. Like don't try weed and sleeping pills at the same time.
* Working out and eating healthy
* After my bad days: Lots of sugar, electrolytes, and water. Gravol helps with feeling dizzy and nauseous during the day.

## Things I tried but didn't help me in the long term:

* **Melatonin**: If I did sleep with it, it was quality sleep, but didnt really regulate my circadian rhythm. Its also not super recommended by people in health care.
* **Phenibut**: Low dosage was good for once a week to catch up on sleep but its fairly addictive. You get awesome dreams on it I must admit.
* **Prescribed Indica Weed** was amazing at first because I didnt feel hazy the next day compared to Zoplicone but tolerance built after two weeks of continual use. Soon I was up all night wondering why it wasnt working.
* **Zolpidem** had no effect at all even after doubling my dosage
* **3.75mg Zoplicone** was my main drug of choice and was able to use it for 7 months without exceeding three days a week (as recommended)
* **Having strict bedtimes**. I saw online it was good sleep hygeine to be consistent. This is true for the average person but I was so far gone that it was just another stress to worry about.",Zolpidem

106,"Called in sick today on my first day back due to insomnia. Ugh. I'm going through a really bad phase of insomnia which all started around christmas eve. I was out with friends on christmas eve and ended up falling asleep on my friends couch and awoke early and quite hungover. That day I was so tired all day but when It got to bed time I didn't feel any more tired and just stayed in my current tired phase. I ended up not sleeping for the next 5 days (i got 3 hours after 1 10mg zolpidem on the 5th day - my doctor prescribed me these, but used to give me zopiclone which i found worked better)

So I ended up going to an out of hours doctor (back home with parents) got zopiclone and slept okay with zopiclone for the next 4 days, then I stopped zopiclone, didn't really sleep the first night off, second night off was pretty bad but next night was okay, then last night I was half asleep half awake still 2 o clock i decided enough was enough and took half a zopiclone slept from 2am-3.05am then was awake ever since. Probably should of taken a full tablet but I had to be up for half 7.

So.. today I am wrecked I feel completely off my senses are ruined, sounds that are really far awake sound close and my perception of everything is off, my eyesight is terrible so I text in sick and it's my first day back today I feel so bad.

I hate insomnia, this is like my fifth ""phase"" of it to go through. Literally one bad night can spiral out of control for me and I go into this weird phase of just constantly tired but unable to sleep.",Zolpidem
107,"Holy crap Well this is the worst it's been in a long while. I never have trouble falling asleep when I've taken zolpidem (aka Ambien etc) but today I'm hyper. Brain won't stop. No negative thoughts, just thinking and planning household chores and stuff. Even finally ordered a steam mop online in the middle of the night.

Actually contemplating going *eff it* and not sleeping at all. But, I don't want to be zombie tomorrow now that I'm more or less a single dad of two. Then again I'm not sure I can avoid that at all.

112,"Hard time with meds So, I’ve had chronic insomnia for about 8 years now, but about 3 years ago I entered college, so I started taking Zolpidem to get some better sleep when I got tests or really busy days (Yes, I have a psychiatrist and a neurologist, I didn’t medicate myself). The problem is that in the last months, I’ve been taking more pills that I should, because I lose consciousness when I take meds, it’s a common thing with sleep meds. So, about 3 months ago, my parents started to control the pills so I wouldn’t have any accident cooking or making some tea, etc. But secretly, I have been taking more pills during some rough days of no good sleep, but today my mom find out and felt really disappointed, and it shocked me a lot. So I want to start changing all my sleep routines. 
The reason that I came here to ask you, it’s because I have a really ""healthy"" life, I go to the gym and do some spinning so I get really tired, I only drink coffee in the morning, I try not to eat before bed, I don’t use my cellphone before sleep, I even try to meditate and all. So yeah, I know that a lot of you have had Zolpidem too and other have had other meds, but everyone here shares insomnia, so the actual problem is the same for all of us. 
So, could you give me some advices? Some things that have helped you? Oh yes, I forgot, I smoke weed too and it helped A LOT, but I don’t smoke often in my house. But in my country, cannabis is illegal, so I can’t even get some cannabidiol or take some oil of cannabis to sleep, that’s not a solution for me unfortunately.",Zolpidem
113,"Zolpidem until cbt? Hi. I’ve had insomnia on and off for about 2 years now, got way worse when I got my depression November last year. 
I’ve had most sleep meds that aren’t “addictive” (only know the Swedish names, but atarax, propavan, theralen, circadin, quetiapin and regular melatonin tablets) and none of these work.
Had zopiclone for awhile, but overdosed heavily late April and got to use them for a bit during summer but they stopped working(got used to them I guess).
So I’ve been thinking now to ask my doctor tomorrow to start cbt for sleep, but I think there’s like a waiting list or something like that..
I want to sleep, even after being awake for 44 hours I could sleep for 3-4 hours. And then 4,5hours the night after. 
I’d like to try zolpidem during the nights I know it’ll be hell, and not too often so I get used to them. I rather stay out of regular benzodiazepines.

Is this a bad idea?",Zolpidem
114,"Zolpidem post So, about a year ago I started taking Zolpidem in different medications (different night time action and rapidness) but I started, obviously because of the side effects, doing things that I don’t remember, like sending messages, voice messages to people I didn’t have any strong friendship, I started to eat or drink things without noticing, so my parents started to worry about my health whenever I do these things. I’ve talked to my psychiatrist and neurologist, but all of their tactics didn’t work on me. So I decided to ask you guys, some with the same medication as me, and with the same possible side effects. How did you manage to pass on this problems? Is there any solution?",Zolpidem
115,"Ambien questions Hi guys, for about the last year, I’ve been suffering from insomnia, just didn’t have time to go to the doctor. I was diagnosed, and given a prescription for 10mg Zolpidem (Ambien.) This was the best sleep I have had in over a year. Before I was prescribed Ambien, I had been self medicating with a small amount of marijuana before bedtime every night. Marijuana used to work great for me. I would sleep for 8 hours straight without waking up, up until the last year. While I do like a little toke before bedtime, it knocks me out still, I am just not able to stay asleep for more than an hour. I was wondering if anybody has tried the combination of cannabis and Ambien. I have read other threads throughout reddit, and it seems people only take Ambien to stay awake and smoke cannabis to “trip.” I guess what I am wondering is, has anybody noticed an interaction with the cannabis and Ambien such as the Ambien not being as effective?",Zolpidem
116,"Do you get much cross-tolerance between alcohol and Z-drugs (such as zolpidem (Ambien))? I'm trying to limit the frequency and dose of my GABA-ergic sleeping pill intake to avoid building up too much tolerance (and also to reduce risk of dementia and arrhythmia, and also because my supply is restricted by the legal requirement for prescription). 

I've noticed that zolpidem (Ambien) seems more tolerance-resistant than benzos, but I'm still afraid of sabotaging my efforts by having too much alcohol in between zolpidem doses.",Zolpidem
117,"Zolpidem prescribed for sleep, tolerance to alprazolam Just quick background: I've had anxiety for the last couple years, I'm in my late 30's.  I've been prescribed 1mg xanax (alprazolam) for panic attacks and generalized agoraphobia for about 3 years now.  I've for the most part gotten past the panic attacks and my anxiety levels are almost back to how I was earlier in my life when I wasn't on anything and I've tapered myself off xanax at least when it comes to anxiety.  

So I've developed a sleep issue, where I really struggle with falling asleep.  (what else is new).  I've tried everything under the sun that is legal and tried a variety of pot.  The only thing that works every time is popping a xanax.  Its my last resort though, and I know all about rebound anxiety so hate to take it if I don't need to.  So I told my doctor all this and he prescribed zolpidem (ambien) 10mg for sleep to take instead of xanax when I have trouble falling asleep.  Whats weird is I hear from so many stories from friends/family/internet that it should knock me out, but in my circumstance, Its like it doesn't do anything at all.  If anything it keeps me up. 

A family member that seems to have a deeper issue with sleeping (at least from their perspective) has told me that it would always knock them out and they could rely on it.  I've been trying to help them with their sleep at the same time as figuring it out for me so my knowledge around their sleep is pretty in depth.  This person was never on alprazolam though, so I'm thinking maybe they didn't have a tolerance to either drug.

I have read about cross tolerance with benzos (alprazolam in my case) and know that it could just be that I need to take a larger dose to get it to work but I'm worried about sleep walking and the like of getting the next dose up.  I'm kind of bummed out about this as the day my dr. prescribed it, I was thinking, yes I can finally sleep, but taking it that night did nothing and now I'm confused.  Admittedly, the first night I took it before playing Overwatch, expecting to feel the onset and then going to bed, but all I noticed was my eyes got slightly out of focused and when going to bed at that point, I couldn't sleep.  I know people are going to suggest no gaming/tv/excitement past a certain point in my evening.  I have tried that for more than a week straight and it doesn't matter either way.  The only difference is when I'm laying in bed the week that I don't have excitement in my evening I don't feel intense exhaustion, which is nicer, but I'm still staring at the back of my eyelids all night.  I've developed the practice of mindfulness meditation and have had a pretty good job of actively zooming out from my own train of thoughts.  I've tried all kinds of sleepy teas, melatonin, etc and nothing works.  My wife even bought me a dodu machine and breathing with it doesn't put me to sleep, if anything it wakes me up.  I bought a oculus quest and do beat saber and the like as exercise in the morning, hoping it would help me fall asleep at night.  It hasn't seemed to do anything different and before I didn't do any exercise.

The only current better outcome I have noticed is even with the crappy sleep, I feel less groggy in the morning if the only thing I take is the zolpidem, prior to that I was taking like benedryl and the like and they did next to nothing and made me a zombie the next day.  Anyway, I like doing my homework before talking to my doctor, he knows my history, but I don't think doctors really do their extensive homework all the time when it comes to cross tolerance and the like.  I am surprised after trying it that it didn't work at all and thats how I ended up doing the research and he (dr) probably just hasn't run into this exact situation yet.

I keep feeling like I'm at wits end and I don't know what to do and I'm actually a little hesitant to mention to my doctor that it doesn't work, because it seems like that is not the norm.  He started to suggest I try an antidepressant, but what he suggested he'd already had me try (lexapro and sertraline) both of which made my sleep worse even if I took them in the morning instead of bedtime, so I don't want to explore alternative anti depressants at this point, as it takes to long to figure out if its working and I just want to sleep.  I am so exasperated I don't even know what the point of this post is.  I'm not even asking a real question just hoping someone has a similar experience and figured out a way to better sleep but given all the things I've tried including breathing exercises and sleeping machines, I have a feeling I'm so deep there is just not going to be a fix all and it makes me want to curl up in the corner.",Zolpidem
118,"Trouble with Ambien? I’ve (23M) been having trouble sleeping for the last week. Since last Thursday or Friday I’d basically fall asleep for 2-3 hours, wake up for 30-45 minutes and then just kind of cycle through waking up/falling asleep every hour until I had to wake up for work. 

I hadn’t been stressed at all before this began (though naturally I’m now very stressed about trying to fall asleep), so I went to a doctor yesterday to see if there was maybe any kind of underlying health issue causing this. I was prescribed Zolpidem (Ambien) and took one last night before going to bed. 

I ended up waking up after about 4-1/2 hours of sleep, which I originally took to be a good sign, as that was the longest I’d slept consecutively all week, and I normally wake up around that time during the night to go to the bathroom before quickly falling asleep again. However, after I went to the bathroom and returned to bed I was completely unable to fall back asleep, and ended up tossing and turning for the next 3-4 hours before my alarm went off. 

Has anyone who’s taken Ambien before had issues similar to this? I realize that it’s only been one night so I know I may be prematurely freaking out here a bit. Also, for reference, I had similar sleep issues last year during a particularly stressful period of time and was prescribed Ambien, though the doctor ended up taking a long time to call in the prescription so by the time I had the pills my sleep issues had pretty much subsided already.",Zolpidem
119,"Switching from Zopiclone to Ambien I have had insomnia for my entire life (currently in my late 20s) and only just found this sub, what have I been doing all this time! In any case, I have always been reluctant to take sleeping pills until things got so bad around Jan this year and I allowed the doc to prescribe an antihistamine which I took for around 3 weeks every night until it became ineffective. I then switched to zopiclone (7.5mg) of which I took 1 per night, in a bid to circumvent tolerance I was taking no more than 3 or 4 per week. This worked pretty well until recently where I have had to up the dose to 2 per night. I REALLY do not want to get into the 3 / 4 per night territory because surely at that point addiction and or dependence is only round the corner ? To avoid this I have acquired 30 pills of Zolpidem (10 mg) and I am wondering if anyone else has made such a switch and can advise if it is safe and effective? Would my tolerance to Zopiclone carry over to Zolpidem or would I effectively be starting with a clean slate? Also in another bid to circumvent tolerance I would like to start on a lower than average dose so with my history can anyone comment on whether or not I would get away with taking 5mg first time round? I have read that having an empty stomach before taking it will produce he best results, is there any similar advice anyone else can offer about zolpidem?

122,"insomnia, anxiety and depression/suicidal thoughts I have had insomnia for just over two months now. The first night it happened I had got to sleep fine but got woken up two hours later by my 3 year old hysterically crying because she was having a nightmare. I couldn't get back to sleep because my anxiety levels had skyrocketed. I was then super anxious about the possibility of not being able to sleep the following night, which meant I didn't sleep and on and and on it has gone in an awful cycle. I've taken some kind of sleep medication most days since this started.  The dr's tell you not to but I really don't know what else to do. I've tried CBTi (following an online course) for about 4 weeks before switching to hypnosis and mindfulness for the past month. I've had two breakthrough periods where I managed to go some nights without prescription sleep aids and actually sleep but these total around 2 weeks out of two months. I felt really positive for these times but I have ended up rebounding, with the anxiety around sleep seemingly taking me over again. It's leaving me feeling so low, I don't really enjoy anything anymore. Every day is a struggle, I feel constantly dizzy, fuzzy headed, anxious and I have symptoms like chest tightness, palpitations, fatigue and low motivation. I've been back and forth to my GP so many times and they won't prescribe any more sleep medication because I've already taken it for longer than they would advise. My GP started me on mirtazapine 15mg almost three weeks ago. I took it combined with zolpidem 10mg in the first week. The second week, I was sleeping around 9 hours with that and an OTC sleep aid. I had started feeling quite positive again and thought I may be getting better but my mind had other ideas. This stint of good sleep lasted a week and this week I'm now back to being a nervous, miserable wreck. I feel so helpless and I don't know what to do anymore. I don't really know how I've ended up like this, I used to be like all other good sleepers who go to bed and not even have to think about whether they're going to sleep well or not. I wish I didn't care, I know the anxiety around sleep is not helping but I feel helpless in overcoming it. I'm resigned to living my life like a zombie - either by taking sleep medication just to get through, or not taking meds and so not getting any sleep.

I only take the smallest dose which I think is like 5mg (or is it mcg? whatever seems more likely).

I have seen a doctor a week ago about this, and was prescribed zolpidem 10mg. When I take only one pill (as per instruction by doctor), it does absolutely nothing for me, I've taken zoldpidem 10mg before i try to sleep for 4 out of 5 nights, staying awake for every waking second of the 4 days, then I tried taking two pills one night, and slept for 8 hours, I don't know if that was a fluke or not. Now I am out of zoldpiem as I was only prescribed for 7 days worth to start out. Since two nights ago I have bought some melatonin 10mg tablets over the counter. Yesterday I have taken 10mg zoldpidem + 10mg melatonin, has no effect. Tonight I tried taking 10mg melaton by itself (since I ran out of zoldpidem), and then 5mg after staying in bed for 3 hours from 9pm to 12pm, and now I am on this subreddit at 3pm.

129,"I'm so, so tired.   

I'm sorry, a long ramble is coming up, I just need to vent. I'm so tired I feel like I've got a fish tank in the place of my head, dead fish glooping inside.

I've had a shitty summer, fall, and now winter.

Really, I've had trouble sleeping most of my life. My mom, now in her late sixties, likes to tell stories of how I was such a sweet, sweet baby, but I'd lie awake all night, just staring at the ceiling, and then sleep peacefully only during the days. Me, I remember curling in bed under the blankets when I was below double digits, reading by flashlight because I couldn't seem to sleep and it was making me anxious.

As an adult, I'm bipolar, and I'd be okay with being bipolar I think if I could just sleep. If I could just sleep like normal people sleep. If I could go to bed at 11PM and shut my eyes and be asleep within an hour or two, hell, if it just took four or five hours that'd be okay too, I guess. 

For years, I gobbled down every sleeping pill the doctors cared to throw at me, and it made me pathetically miserable and didn't do much to help the problem in the first place. Sometimes they'd help for a few weeks until I'd adjusted and then I'd feel worse off than when I started. I think zolpidem was what was nicest on my brain except when it gave me weird, hallucinating trips and I had to stop. A number of ineffective meds later, I was on Flunitrazepam which knocked me into inky orbit but made me feel like my mind had turned to sludge - it didn't seem like sleep at all. After I realised that a friend had molested me while I was passed out, I had a meltdown and decided that no matter how hard and how ugly things'd get, I'd find a way to live without sleep meds because I didn't want to live like that. I threw it all away. Then caved and got new pills - continued for a couple of months with no more luck... then threw them away again, and now haven't touched the stuff for three years. 

Sleep is shit. It's absolute utter shit. Therapy doesn't help, though I tried. Even when I'm in a period of relatively good sleep, the mere concept is such a point of anxiety now. The bed is a warzone of tossing and turning and sweating and churning, and my internal clock keeps ticking away towards the hour when I know I need to get out of bed. When someone comments that I look tired and I tell them I've had a bad night, and they agree that they sometimes have a little trouble sleeping and I should try some tea before bed or why not meditation - I feel this horrible, trembling envy that makes me nauseous, but I smile politely and say \*thank you\*, and \*I'll try\*.

If I'm lucky, if I have zero plans the next day, if I've been out and the weather was nice and I got plenty of light, if the bed seems extraordinarily comfy, if the cats are cuddly sweethearts, if my limbs feel heavy and soft, if I'm not too tired and not too fearful and not too alert nor too sluggish... I might sleep. Might be eight hours - might be four. I'll take whatever I get and be damn grateful for it.

Previously my doctor had me stop taking it for about six months and when I started it back up it worked great for a couple years. Well now I’m here again and my doctor wants to me to try to cycle off it for a while. 

Well the issue is I now have a great job, and those six months last time were HELL. I felt like my ambien wasn’t working before but I guess it was way better than nothing. So for the past couple weeks I’ve been taking 20mg on nights before work, but obviously my script is low. So I need ideas on what to supplement. 

I don’t know the support on this sub for Marijuana, however that is the best sleep I have ever received. My work doesn’t drug test, however we are currently caring for a family member who was just released from rehab so obviously I want to avoid that. 

I’m currently trying that cbd oil thing, it’s night one and I’m not asleep yet so there’s that. I don’t know how effective it actually is and it tasted horrible! However if anyone has any good CBD edible recommendations I would appreciate it! Or anything else for that matter. Except all of this imagine you are somewhere or melatonin stuff. I went though a program with a doctor on how to teach me how to fall asleep better, didn’t work. I also was going through a months supply of melatonin in a week. 

Also I’ll mention I have a weighted blanket on the way, after the one I ordered had a hole in it.

135,"How I got rid of insomnia Maybe it sounds like a clickbait title, and maybe I'm not cured. But I can certainly say that I don't have any jolts or any other symptoms of anxiety combined with it.

Everything started in May 2018. As a result of a panic attack in my sleep, I had to endure many sleepless nights. 30-40 hours of sleep, then I had to pop a Benadryl and sleep.

Time goes forward, with a lot of migraines, anxiety and many other symptoms (aches & stuff). In June I went to a psych, and he told me to get Xanax, Doxepin (a horrible drug, don't take it) and Zolpidem. From Doxepin I had the worst anxiety, and when I wanted to sleep, I experienced random jolts.

I get my treatment, and my anxiety is not cured. Psych prescribed Zoloft, which was a wonderful drug (for me). I had to take it with Xanax and Doxepin, but I said no to those and I took Zoloft alone for two weeks, until I said 'let's see if I can work without it.' And it's incredible that now I can fall asleep without problems, even though I wake up after 3-4 hours.

I don't suffer from that anxiety anymore, even though I have panic attacks (induced by my mind). But I have to battle with gastritis/ulcer/whatever it is idk.",Zolpidem

Before, it was impossible to keep my eyes open and I would be out within 15 minutes. I was prescribed Xanax for two weeks and that definitely helped at times (.5-1 mg). But I’m no longer taking that and am on zolpidem tartrate 5 mg which doesn’t work nearly as well. Some nights it doesn’t work at all, others I wake up after 4-5 hours. I’ve taken some melatonin and had vivid dreams at times.

138,"Please help...I’m so scared about not being able to sleep... I’ve been lurking on this sub over the past month or so (which is when my insomnia started). Before all of this, I used to sleep so soundly. Over the last few months or so, a lot of stress has been going on in my life (new job, moved to a new city away from my family, one of my family members suffered a stroke.) needless to say, it’s been rough and the whole insomnia has greatly heightened my anxiety. The thing is, all of that other stuff had happened months prior, but sleeplessness just started to affect me last month. Now I have more and more anxiety about not being able to sleep, feeling as though I have a fatal disease. I’ve always sort of been a hypocondriac, but this is completely new. I was prescribed Xanax for a short while and it helped put me to sleep for the night. I just could not sleep without it. The only other time I did was the first three days when this all started when I took some melatonin and knocked me out. Ever since the melatonin has been useless. Now I’m taking 5mg zolpidem tartrate, but it doesn’t work as well as the Xanax. I wake up after 4-5 hours. When I try to sleep on my own, I just can never get there or it’s completely unrefreshing. I’m woken up by hypnic jerks. I just don’t know what to do or if I should keep relying on the Ambien at this point. I had an appointment today and the doc wanted to prescribe me 10mg melatonin to take every day. I also scheduled a sleep study, but that won’t be for another month. This is probably all due to my anxiety...I’ve been having terrible headaches and uneasiness lately, likely due to the fact I’m still unable to sleep properly.


Something to note: when this all started, I experienced a weakness in my muscles, diffculty swallowing and dizziness, along with a burning sensation on one side of my face (which I still experience when trying to sleep, but it’s not painful, just uncomfortable and usually subsides after a minutes) - what could all of this be? A panic/anxiety attack from all the stress catching up with me? It doesn’t help that I was freaking myself out the days leading up that weird experience by thinking I had some disease. Hopefully someone can give me me advice. I just want to sleep normally again. ",Zolpidem
139,"Any sleeping pill similar to or better than Ambien (zolpidem)? this may be a little long, sorry. backstory: 
I'm taking 10mg of ambien, well technically more like 20-25mg because i need at least 2 to get me to sleep now. Problem is, i'm only prescribed 30 so taking 2 or more a night, you can do the math, i'm out long before i can get another refill. i've been on it for a little over 2 years now. my tolerance is getting too high. 

so i'm curious to know what works for you guys or if you have any advice on how i can lower my tolerance or something. i like the ambien, not only the euphoric feeling before bed (which is nice because i'm severely depressed during the day), but when it works, it works. i go to sleep, stay asleep, & wake up functioning properly. 

i highly doubt my doctor will increase me to 60 pills, he's already said there's no dose higher than 10mg (is that even true?), but i'm afraid to tell him about this because if he takes me off of it & puts me on something else & it doesn't work i'm back at square one. i've tried manyyyy things before getting to ambien btw. 

TLDR: if you're on a sleeping pill that's working for you, what is it? what does it feel like? and is there anything similar or better than ambien?

edit: a bit more about me if this helps. if i don't have my ambien, i will pretty much not sleep until my body physically tires itself out & i pass out from exhaustion aka ~ 2 days. i'm also taking 1mg clonazepam for anxiety, but had some issues with my doctors so my ambien script & my klonopin script come really far apart, i'll always have only one & not the other when i'm actually supposed to be taking them together as my full treatment. any advice or tips regarding sleeping pills would be much appreciated. i'm desperate, frustrated, and extremely depressed. i need sleep..

I'm a 22 year old Student and have severe insomnia. I have been diagnosed with Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrom about 3 years ago.  I have tried pretty much everything.

I have been prescribed: 

- Zolpidem (Ambien) 
- Diazepam (Valium) 
- Triazolam (Halcion) 
- Alprazolam (Xanax) 
- Lorazepam (Ativan) 

-  About 5 different Medication that did not help , including a few antidepressants and Seroquel. (I am NOT depressed - this was only for sleep)

I have also tried:
- Cannabis
- Alcohol

Ambien and Cannabis where the only two things that really helped. The Problem with Ambien beeing it just fucks up my Memory SERIOUSLY.

The Problem with Cannabis beeing: It makes me unmotivated , is expensive and illegal(at least its pretty much decriminalized).

My trouble is that I go into a really deep sleep, and already have very selective hearing anyway! I don’t hear my alarm on loud, and once I’m asleep, then I’m REALLY asleep. 

I am not waking up to my alarm. My housemate has to wake me and even then I am not fully awake sometimes

I know I take  sleeping tablets. But I’ve been taking them for +3 years, same dosage, same brand. So nothing has changed. This problem is not relative to them. I have just been working full time and studying my degree online. I assume my body is just tired these days. But this is a problem for my job and waking up. I am getting to work on time with the help of my housemate waking me. But if no one is home - I have resorted to avoiding early morning shifts as best I can and taking the evening shifts. 

How can I get myself to wake up and hear my alarm when it’s already on loud? Again, the issue is that I don’t hear my alarm, or it just blends into my dream, or I snooze my alarm while I’m half asleep. 

Any tips? It’s very stressful having to worry about this everyday and make sure my housemate remembers to wake me for work before leaving. 

Alternatively, does anyone know of any alarm apps that are reliable and effective?

149,"2 long months of severe insomnia - Making me want to quit studying I'm 20 years old, male, and i've had insomnia my whole life. As a child, I would see hallucinations right before falling asleep. However my insomnia would only last a couple of nights and be gone for a while.

Well things changed when I moved to a new city to study. Never in my life had I taken sleep medication of any kind. This was about to change. I went on an introduction trip (university), where we had to drink for 2 consecutive nights. I didn't sleep the first night, and the second night I slept 2 hours. 
When I came home, I would begin to wake up early every single morning without fail. This gave me 4-5 hours on average for the first month. I really became anxious of not sleeping. This also lead to feeling very depressed and stressed. 
Suddenly I started to wake up EVERY HOUR-2 HOURS. It took me 30 mins - 3 hours to fall back asleep, and I functioned on 4-5 hours of broken sleep. 2 weeks ago, I started to not being able to sleep once I woke up. This gave me 3 hours of sleep on average for the last 2 weeks. 
The thing is, as you could image, studying and having this severe insomnia is really hard, and has already made me think about dropping out, which I in reality don't want to do, because this is what I want to do with my life. 

So here's the meds: 
Zolpidem (Ambien)
I started on Zolpidem (Ambien), took 5 mg and it gave me 4 hours of sleep and headache. Stopped for days, but I went on and off, and to this day I've run out of it (10 pcs of 5mg). Every time, I would get >4 hours of sleep, and it even gave me 2 hours at one time.

Melatonin
The next step was melatonin (at this point I had only tried ambien 2 times). It actually worked (gave me 8+ hours) for a week, but I really felt depressed and drowsy. When I take melatonin today, I can usually sleep within an hour but, I will still wake up after 1-3 hours. I have taken melatonin the most, almost daily, on small doses (1/4 of a 2mg pill), and also at the normal 2mg dose. 

Seroquel 25mg - 50mg:
This stuff only put me to sleep for 4 hours like Ambien (some people literately sleep 13 hours on this stuff), however unlike Ambien, I wasn't secured to get knocked out. I would only get kinda drowsy. I have only taken this 3-4 times. 

Other stuff
I tried valerian root, d-vitamin, c-vitamin, magnesium, new pillows, diet with bananas, cheeries, sleep hygiene, reading, meditation, sleep music. You name it. 


My theory is that i've gotten depressed, and melatonin, which is converted from serotonin (the happiness hormone), makes me even more depressed. When the body senses an increase in melatonin, it signals the body to produce less serotonin? I don't know, I'm desperate and I want to hear if anyone has any input on this?",Zolpidem

But once every 1-2 months I get these extreme episodes where my brain kinda explodes with thoughts, and I just can't sleep at all. Pills won't work. Tried taking 70+mg of both zolpidem and zopiclone over the course of a night without effect, and have tried a buttload of different benzos as well. Once I reach 72+ hours without sleep, I drink till I pass out, and this usually ends the ''attack''. But it's not really a great way to deal with it.

- Weed

- PSG sleep study

- Cognitive therapy

 What then happens the day before i go to bed and my hearts starts pounding, i swat etc. so real anxiety symptoms.
My thoughts when i am lying in bes are:

""What happens if i can`t sleep?"" ""Will i get crazy?"" ""Will i have to call in for sick days?""
Will i be able to work?

155,"Lorazepam (Ativan) and zolpidem (Ambien) stopped working. Back in May, I got my first full-time job and moved out of my parents' house. The job has me doing 12-hour night shifts, so as a person who already struggles with anxiety, depression, and insomnia, sleep is more of a precious resource than ever.

It took several weeks for me to adjust to having a ""real"" job with long shifts and living without my parents. There were also some traumatic events that occurred shortly after I moved that plagued me with constant panic attacks and left me struggling to eat or sleep. I was already on the lower end of average weight and lost between 5 to 10 lbs., and I was only getting between 1 to 4 hours of sleep every day for 2+ months.

I stopped taking antidepressants earlier in the year, which was a huge mistake. I went to a psychiatrist to start medication again, and I was prescribed a combination of escitalopram (Lexapro) and bupropion (Wellbutrin). She also gave me lorazepam to help with my panic attacks and sleep. It didn't help particularly well with sleep, but it was decent for panic attacks as long as I didn't use it often enough to build a tolerance. Since the lorazepam failed to grant me a full night (er, day) of sleep, she prescribed me zolpidem.

The zolpidem worked at first. In fact, it worked a little *too* well -- I was exhausted even after sleeping for eight hours. However, after 5 days, it stopped working entirely. I decided to try alternating between zolpidem and lorazepam, which worked to some extent. I'm not sure if that will fix the issue anymore, though. Most recently, I woke up two or three times during my slumber before having to leave for work.

My boyfriend sometimes snores like a hibernating bear (how the fuck does he manage to sleep so easily, anyway?), which is grating and exacerbates my sleep issues. I can hear him through earplugs and headphones more often than not. I've left our shared bedroom several times to go sleep on a big piece of cardboard on my office floor. However, I don't think bed quality (or lack thereof) is the issue. Even when I sleep alone in our Tempur-Pedic, I still wake up after a few hours if the sleep aids aren't working.

No drugs helps me. Always wake up after 1 or two hours sleep.

mirtazapine is better; it improves the total amount of the sleep, though, it doesn't solve the problem that I wake up every hour, I feel more peaceful when I wake up during the night, and able to fall back to sleep.

157,"Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and waking up early. Hello,

I'm so glad to have found this subreddit. I feel less alone already!

So, I quit smoking marijuana for my insomnia and epilepsy about a month ago.  Ever since then, my insomnia has come back with a vengeance and I'm having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, and I keep waking up extremely early to start my day (unnecessarily, of course).  I also have severe anxiety, although this does not seem to get too much worse with my recent lack of sleep.  It does make me anxious that I tend to have more seizures when sleep deprived.  However, my epilepsy is decently controlled, so this isn't a huge worry for me.

I have struggled with insomnia for about 10 years (I'm 24), with my only respite being when I was using marijuana.  Even then, I still woke up about 5-10 times a night for a few hours at a time unless I smoked more after awakening.

Last week I was up for about 72 hours straight.  Oddly enough, I felt rather energized from the experience, especially the second time I saw the sun come up without having seen my eyelids.  When I finally fell asleep, I only slept for about three hours.  I'm averaging 2-3.5 hours of sleep a night now.  I generally fall asleep between 12-3 AM and wake up around 3:00-3:30/5:00 AM ready to start my day.  I feel that I am constantly ""wired and tired,"" as another user put it.

I do not consume caffeine or any other stimulants, although I do take Abilify, which I have found to be a bit activating ever since I started taking it last year.  Abilify works well to control my mood, however, so I would like to continue taking it.

Medications I have tried over the years include diphenhydramine, vistaril/hydroxyzine, trazodone, seroquel (up to 300mgs/night), and ambien/zolpidem.  I have also tried herbal remedies and melatonin to no avail.

I do my best to employ good sleep hygiene though I do watch TV in bed as the tv can't be moved elsewhere due to shared house and at my boyfriends house it just isn't possible to move tv to the living room. There's nowhere for it to go. I think this is the only part of sleep hygiene we can't employ.


When I do sleep badly, I get incredibly vivid nightmares about half of the time which may be waking me? I do tend to sleep a bit better at weekends when I've been able to exercise more and such. But currently I am going through a phase for the last few months of 2-3 hours sleep a night most nights. I am a bit anxious about an upcoming hospital appointment  (a first check up after a procedure to remove pre-cancerous cells) and my poor sleep does seem to tie in to the last six months which is when I found out I needed the procedure so I think anxiety may have something to do with it maybe but I really don't have time to see a gp given that I work mon to Fri full time and some Saturdays. 

If anyone has any advice particularly I guess on letting go of the anxiety (since logically I think that may be a part of it though unsure how that makes me wake up mid sleep if I don't struggle to get to sleep currently - it's just a guess) then I would be very grateful. ",Zolpidem
159,"Proper dosage of melatonin? Hi there, I was hoping to get some advice...

I met with a sleep specialist after almost a month of not sleeping who prescribed me 12.5 mg of ER Zolpidem, recommending me to take it for seven days to reset my cycle and then to take meltaonin for a while. I tried melatonin in the past, and it didn't seem to work. The sleep specialist initially recommended taking 1 mg or less three ours before bed. When I tried that, I'd wake up at 3:30 am on the dot and be exhausted for the rest of the day. Let me know what has worked for you. I highly appreciate any advice.",Zolpidem

I posted a few months ago when my doctor put me on zopiclone long term (intermittant usage, max 2-3 times a week, normally 1-2). I've now had a few nights over the last few weeks where there's been a delayed reaction to taking it and I've felt the effects about 4 or 5 hours after taking it. I went back to my doctor today and she's changed me to zolpidem (for the same intermittant use) - I just wanted to ask if anyone would have any concerns about switching or using zolpidem at all?

162,"It's 4am. Been asleep all of 3 hours and that is after my doctor doubled my dose for Zolpidem. I had 5mg previously and it only allowed me to sleep for 3-4 hours max. After months of struggling with it, I went back to my doctor and he gave me 10mg. I've been taking it maybe 4 days now and I'm still only sleeping 3-4 hours. I did post here before and got some recommendations but he said that they were antidepressants or anti-anxiety pills and he was hesitant to prescribe them.

I think part of why I can't sleep is that I burn really hot when I'm sleeping. I often wake up in a sweat. I don't even use a blanket and I use those cooling sheets. I guess there's nothing I can do other than wait for winter to come.",Zolpidem

Sometimes I'm in 11pm at night and work until the next morning. It changes from day to day so there is no regularity in my sleep schedule. I also work weekends and holidays.

My problem is, work has me so mentally exhausted that I'm able to sleep at the drop of a hat. But I always wake up 2 or 3 hours later and I am unable to fall back asleep again and spend the next few hours tossing and turning. And I end up dozing off at work.

I already take melatonin and I also have a 5mg Zolpidem prescription from the doctor which I take only when it's my 3rd or 4th long day with no sleep. At best I get an extra hour or two of sleep. I exercise daily and like to think I lead an active life. I don't have any major worries with regards to money or relationships. My bedroom is mostly black and I have black curtains in order to simulate night.

I love my job and I do not want to try switching to a steady 9-5 job. If possible I would like to stay it it until I retire.

I'm 17, my names karl, and I've had insomnia for 5 years now. I average 3 hours sleep a night, but obviously some nights I sleep better and some much worse. I've gone 7 days without sleep before (with no caffeine etc), and that was pretty scary to say the least. 

I've been to doctor after doctor, each saying the same thing.. 'excersize and don't have the tv on at night'.. well done you. every night, my room is pitch black, no electronics, no lights, no distractions. still cant get to sleep before the sun comes up. 

I've started going on morning bike rides
at about 3 in the morning. the world is so quite and empty, it's quite beautiful. the air is very fresh and damp and the few sparkles under he rising sun. 

I reccomend you guys do this. I went on a bike ride from 3:00 to 5:30 and came back, tried to get back to sleep (which I did eventually at 9am), but I felt very relaxed and refreshed. 

also, splashing very cold water on your face at night or in the morning is blissful.

I have ordered Zopiclone online on 2 occasions over the past 6-months.


Irresponsible of me, I know, but I am a lifelong insomniac...


On the 2 occasions I got the product in the same silver pill packaging. 


Both stated as 'Zopiclone'


With the same dosage (7.5mg)


(I usually take 3.75 milligrams, with melatonin)


Anyways,

One silver pill package contained BLUE pills (film-coated)


The other silver pill package contained WHITE pills (non film-coated)


For me:


The BLUE pills (film-coated) DO NOT help me sleep, but instead keep my mind alert...


They make me do very unusual and risky things: (3.75mg)


E.g. 

Texting strange messages on Facebook,


Marauding around the kitchen, binge eating,


Going on long drives to 24-hour shops.


These blue Zopiclone pills are like AMBIEN side effects...


For anyone who has experienced Ambien... 


However,


The WHITE pills (non film-coated) DO help me sleep.


Straight through the night.


I feel well rested in the morning, without any risky behaviours...

I really need consistency.

'ESZOPICLONE'

Had no idea what insomnia was but I did know I had a hard time falling asleep every single damn night.  Going to sleep became a battle every night. Something I dreaded because it never came. Frequently I’d be up until 2, 3, 4am on a school night. To wake up miserable at 6:30am. My problem was falling asleep, didn’t have a problem with staying asleep. 

I lived my entire life until 19 years old feeling sick, miserable, and sleep deprived stress. But it wasn’t until a 6 months or so after moving out of my parents house. That I realized I could go to a doctor and ask about it (crazy, but I never thought that insomnia was like a real thing or treatable in any way).

My doctor proscribed me Ambien. Absolute game changer. Started getting 8 hours of sleep a night and had immediate noticeable improvements in every area or life (grades in college went up, had better social skills, mood improvement, got sick way less often etc.) 

After a while of Ambien I asked my doctor if I could try something else since I started sleep walking and txting/calling people and not remembering doing any of it the next morning. 

Now I take 3mg of Eszopiclone (Lunesta) and 50mg of amnitryptalyn every night. Absolutely love it. No weird side effects.

186,"I think I cured my insomnia? For the past two years, I struggled with terrible insomnia.  

At its worst, I’d only sleep a few hours each night.  Fall asleep around 10pm, wake up at 1am, and usually not be able to fall asleep again.  If I did, it would only be for an hour or so.

I’ve always been a light sleeper, but this wasn’t mild.  I just could NOT sleep.  Combine that with a 1.5 hour commute in each direction, and I was terrified that I wouldn’t survive.

I’m now at the point where I can reliably sleep 7.5 to 8 hours a night.  

“Cure” might be too strong of a word.  But I’ve been sleeping well for about a month.  Better yet, I can predict how solidly I’ll sleep on any given night.

I’m also convinced that this isn’t a placebo effect.  I tried upwards of 100 different solutions (one a week for two years).  Only three that had an immediate, dramatic impact on my sleep.  If a placebo would have worked, then any of the highly rated products I bought should have helped.

**First, here’s what didn’t work.**

One day I’ll sit down and put together the full list from my Amazon order history.  It was a LOT.  

As you can imagine, it was all of the usual subjects.  Meditation.  Exercise.  Good sleep hygiene.  Melatonin.  Slept in my own bed in a very controlled room.  Blue light reduction.  Tons of supplements.  New pillows.  New mattress topper (that one was really nice, but didn’t help). 

I asked multiple doctors for help.  Blood tests, genetic tests — all came up with interesting theories, but no answers.

I tried the sleep lab / sleep apnea route.  I was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea.  This led to year of misery.  I know CPAP and dental appliances have helped a lot of people, but they didn’t help me at all.  

I stuck with the CPAP for the better part of a year to meet the insurance company’s compliance requirements, but it was torture with no better sleep results.

I also switched entirely to decaf coffee.  Boy, that month sucked.  Especially since it didn’t help my sleep.  

Here’s what did work.  It came in three breakthroughs.  

**First breakthrough — taking sleep meds in the middle of the night.**

My doctor(s) prescribed a number of different medications to try to help.  None worked, though one seemed promising: Lunesta (eszopiclone).  I’d take it before bed and wake up at 2am instead of 1am.  Better, but not by much.

Since it only lasted a few hours, I had an idea.  Try taking some in the middle of the night.  I set my alarm for 12:30am.  I’d wake up, take a Lunestra, and then go back to sleep.  This worked fairly well.  It wasn’t the most restful sleep, but I could get 5-6 hours of sleep.  I’m fairly paranoid about addiction, so I’d only do this 2-3 nights a week — when I really needed it.  

This was enough to make me feel like I wasn’t going to fall asleep on the road while driving.  But it wasn’t a long term solution.

**Second breakthrough — nutritional supplement at the right dosage.**

Early in this process, I tried the supplement GABA for a week.  It didn’t really help.

I went on to try tons of other vitamins and nutritional supplements.

For some reason, after about a year, I decided to revisit GABA.  I did some reading and talked to my doctor, and decided to try it again, this time at a higher dosage.  I took two 750mg tablets before bedtime.

Wham.  That same night, I started sleeping 6+ hours a night (without Lunestra).  HUGE difference.  

I’m sure that GABA won’t work for everyone, and you should talk to your doctor.  But it sure worked for me once I found the right dosage.  It’s continued to work for over 6 months.

**Third breakthrough — nutritional monitoring.**

I was surviving at this point, but definitely not thriving.  6 hours of sleep was way better than where I started, but I was still tired and cranky most days.

The breaking point for me was a family Christmas vacation.  I’d wake up every day at 4am and sit around waiting for everyone else to naturally wake up at 9am or 10am.  And then I’d feel like I really needed a nap around 1pm to feel human.  I felt like a huge burden to my family, and really wanted to fix this.

I decided it was time to collect more data.  It took quite a while, but I’m so glad I did it.

First, I already had an Apple Watch.  I tried a few different sleep tracking apps, and found one that I really liked.

Second, I installed a meal tracking app.  My goal was to figure out the relationship between my diet and my sleep.  I picked one that automatically calculated my daily totals of nutrients (fat, sugar, carbs, Vitamin C, etc.).  It also needed to be able to export this nutrient data to Excel/CSV format.  

Now the hard part begins.

Every day, I was careful to track everything that I ate.  I did this for three months.  

At the end of three months, I exported the data, and then manually went through and added my sleep data for those same three months, day by day.

By having all of this data in one place, I could do a simple regression analysis to find any correlation between my sleep quality and my diet.

I was pleasantly surprised to find two correlations: 
* I slept better on days when I had HIGHER levels of fat
* I slept better on days when I had LOWER levels of sugar

All of the other nutrients didn’t seem to matter.

These were theories that I could test, and I was excited to do so.

For the past month, I’ve been testing the results, and I couldn’t be happier.

Each day, I aim to consume 110 - 130 grams of fat.  This is higher than the recommended amount based on my height and weight.  I try to focus on supposedly “healthy” fats, like avocado, olive oil, and MCT oil.

Each day, I also try to limit my sugar to be under 70 grams.  This has required the most change — no more sugar in my coffee, very limited desserts, even limiting some fruits.  If I do have dessert, I can’t have it right before bed.  I also had to dramatically cut back on alcohol.  

The results have been amazing.  You can look at [this image](https://imgur.com/a/VUr42Vg) — the picture on the left was my sleep back in December (100% = 8 hours of sleep).  The picture on the right is my sleep now.  

The best part?  I can explain the nights of recent bad sleep (<85%).  One of them was a night I had more than one drink (mmmm - Manhattans).  Others followed a day of too much sugar.  The worst night was when I indulged in ice cream right before bed.

I’m a little nervous to see what the high fat diet does to my bloodwork — I think there’s a very real risk that my cholesterol could be significantly worse.  However, I’m doing all of this under a doctor’s supervision, so we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.

The one approach I haven’t tried yet is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.  If the diet causes other issues, I’ll probably try this next.

I’m sharing this not to say “hey, you need GABA and a diet just like mine.”  

I want to share that there IS hope.  I know how hopeless I felt.

I also wanted the share the process I followed to get to something that works for me.  In all of my experiments, I would try to stick with each thing for at least a week.  Some (like the CPAP and decaf) I tried for months.  

I wish I had started the nutritional tracking process much earlier.  I know -- 3-4 months sounds like a long time to run an experiment, but if I had done it earlier I would have saved myself 2 years of misery.

I hope this helps you!

190,"Is Eszopiclone the only Z-hypnotic that can be used for a long term? It's known that Z-hypnotics can't be used on a long-term basis because of tolerance and dependence. Recently I've encountered these two studies which claim Eszopiclone 3mg shows no evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia after 6 and 12 months of treatment:

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978384/
* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16230048

How is that possible considering that Zopiclone, for example, [causes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6669632?dopt=Abstract) rebound insomnia already after just three weeks?

Eszopiclone is not registered in Russia, and I can't just ask my doctor, so I was wondering if you guys could clarify it for me. Is Eszopiclone very different from other Z-hypnotics, or is it only because 3mg is a low dose? Is there anyone who uses it for the long term nightly, or more than two days per week?",Eszopiclone
191,"Mistakes were made and I don't know how but now I'm kind of high I have a 3mg prescription for Eszopiclone and it does approximately nothing.  Shitloads of Melatonin makes me tired, but I don't sleep; previously I used suvorexant to trigger sleep, and Eszopiclone seems to handle the same.

Trying to cut back on MT, I lowered my dose from 20mg to 15mg and added 500mg of Magnesium.  Magnesium has made me sleep soundly before.

Now I can't sleep and I feel ... something like how I feel if I drink too much port wine.

Apparently this is a muscle relaxant now.

Well shit.  I feel pretty good but this is not what I was going for.  I obviously need to talk with my psychiatrist; I have no idea how a metal ion could interact with a GABA receptor positive allosteric modulator like this (granted, the drug itself works by increasing the Cl- ions passing into the neuron--not the point).

(The high amounts of MT aren't because it's built a tolerance; it never worked well on me until I reached that target dose, and I'm still refusing to believe I just flatly need 20mg 8h CR MT.  I should need 0.3mg.)",Eszopiclone

do you think I could get Zolpidem(ambian)? not every day, just sometimes I have a lot of trouble sleeping. maybe I could ask for only like 5 for those tough nights? other options include various benzos, Doxylamine, Chloral hydrate, Eszopiclone, Zaleplon. also I could go the natural route (melatonin, cannabis, passionflower, valerian root) I can't take anything ssri, tricyclic because I'm on effexor and it interacts.

It rarely happens with zaleplon and thats normally only in the 20mg dose(it's only happen to me once in 1 1/2 years). You can get prescribed two a night. Incase you have the problem of when you wake up you can go back to sleep. Zolpidem can cause a hangover. It shouldn't be inpossible to get a hangover on Zaleplon as its half life is only a hour.

Been a chronic hardcore insomniac for, gosh, probably 15-17 years now (I'm 43). I've had some really rough points over the years, some of the worst of which was around October 2020 through March. Between Covid, the election and general state of affairs in the USA, and a job that wasn't the right fit for me and causing some deeper anxiety, well, that was a patch.

In the early years I was prescribed Ambien, Lunesta, the one with the otters or whatever. Hated all of it -- definitely met the Ambien walrus more than once, Lunesta made everything taste like metallic shit the next day, and I don't know what I didn't like about the one featuring otters in their marketing, but like -- I don't need no otters to get to sleep.

I've had much better luck with low-dose Seroquel for many years now (over a decade, around 25mg most of that time), and while I'm not totally sure the medical mary really helps much, it does something for me -- certainly helps cope with the really blurgh days, you know, those ones where you've only had a few hours of sleep the past few nights. Say three hours of sleep over the past three nights. You know. :) I have some Zaleplon to get me out of a jam on tougher nights -- trying to not use it too often, for obvious reasons.

But took 2 hours to fall asleep and when I did it was for an hour and laid awake from 3-530am and then sent home.

My sleep hygiene is great and I am still left with chronic insomnia. I’ve tried Anti-psychotics, which wear off effectiveness after a week. Also, z-drugs like ambien, lunesta and I’ve tried Temazepam, which works sometimes, but leaves me feeling exhausted on top of my already excessive daytime sleepiness. And anti-depressants like mirtazapine and trazodone. Nothing has worked properly, I’m thinking my insomnia is severe enough to warrant a medication for severe insomnia.

202,"Zaleplon (Sonata) a few nights a week has worked wonders for me. My issues are entirely based in falling asleep for the first time and not staying asleep.  Have been dealing with this for over a decade and the older I got, the harder it was to go on 2-3 hours of sleep a night for work.

I had tried every OTC and suggestion I could find.  Eventually said screw it and went to a doctor.  I had done my research and was pretty sure that zaleplon was what I needed since it only lasts like two hours but the doctor suggested I tried trazadone first.  It didn't work and only made me groggy the next day.  Eventually after a drug test I was prescribed 30 zaleplons (short acting ambiens as I like to refer to them).  I only take them 2-4 nights a week and when I do I'm out pretty much as soon as they kick in.

Not spending hours a night trying to fall asleep has improved my overall sleep time/quality even on nights I don't take it.  It's almost as if being able to fall asleep whenever I want has helped my brain (which is usually running at 100 mph in bed) shut itself off when in bed even without the drug.  

It has only been a month but i've had zero negative side effects but one funny story.  My gf was over watching anime trying to fall asleep after I went to bed soon after taking it.  She accidentally woke me up, I looked over and said ""why the fuck did you wake me up, Sasha?"" then instantly fell back asleep.  I don't remember any of it but it makes for a funny story.

Doxepin, anything over the counter.  I think that's all. With the exception of Temazepam and Melatonin, the meds have given me either adverse side effects or absolutely no relief at all.

Currently taking: 1 30mg Temazepam per night

Current issues: Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, multiple nights per week without any sleep, restless leg.

I have a dark room, big bed, comfy pillow, cold.  I stop screens at an hour before bed.  I only use the bed for sleep and sex.  I don't watch tv in bed.

I do all of this because it's easier to get it all out up front.  Anyways, I post because I want to receive some guidance on my next journey.  I've been dealing with the same sleep doctor for many years now and he's done a great job at helping me.  But this past visit on Thursday we basically reached the end of the road.  He told me that he really is out of options and he is not sure what to do next.

So I'm now wondering what should I do next.  I'm currently dealing with the worst stretch of insomnia I've ever deal with in my life over the last three weeks.  I'm averaging about 10 hours of sleep per week.  Typically I have two nights back to back where I don't sleep at all.  For example this past Tuesday I woke up at 5 and then didn't fall asleep until Thursday at 630am.  

I just really don't know what to do.  I've done blood work and my primary care doctor identified some areas I need to work on.  I'm trying to eat a healthy diet.  I avoid caffeine at all past 11am.

It’s not fun, especially having a SO that falls asleep before 9pm every night. I’ve tried a number of different meds, including every OTC sleep aid possible, natural herbs and combinations of natural aids, trazodone, Zaleplon, Wellbutrin, copious amounts of weed, good sleep hygiene, everything. I have a whole number of behavioral disorders, chronic pain, and traumatic events in my past likely causing my sleeplessness, but that’s not the point. I recently went out on a limb and saw a new PCP (difficult due to severe anxiety and depression) and it went better than I could have ever imagined. She was so sympathetic and listened so well and immediately was like, “wow no wonder you’ve been having difficulties that’s incredibly hard to function at your level” and prescribed me methocarbamol, flexeril, and Cymbalta and I’ve been able to get 7 hrs a night at least twice over the past 3 weeks! This is so exciting for me, after struggling so badly most of my life, to finally feel like I don’t have to live like this, suffering every day. It’s tough because I get up at 5am everyday for work so when I can’t fall asleep until 3am my work takes a toll.

I messaged my sleep doctor office last night and told them I needed something different.  Ambien is nuts.  I can't even describe how much it erases my memory and how much I do and have no memory of it the next day.  Plus, it isn't that great with helping my sleep.  But here's the thing - I like how it makes me feel leading up to bed.  It helps me to relax and to unwind, it prepares me for sleep much more effectively if that make sense.

206,"Success story: How I got my severe chronic insomnia under control Wanted to post my success story in case it’s helpful to anyone here. TL;DR CBT-I worked wonders for me and I no longer take pills to sleep.

I had severe insomnia for almost 2 years until recently. After a stressful period in life, I stopped being able to stay asleep and this turned into full blown insomnia. After several months of no improvement and worsening anxiety, which in turn led me to develop depression, I went to a psychiatrist. They diagnosed anxiety and depression and put me on Lexapro and Trazodone. Didn’t do well on those and switched from lexapro to Prozac, and stopped taking the trazodone. I started taking whatever I could get my hands on to sleep: benzos like Xanax or klonopin, gabapentin, weed. The benzos worked best but I knew they wouldn’t be a permanent solution.

I went to a sleep specialist who ordered a sleep study. They didn’t find any apnea or narcolepsy. For some reason they put me on modafinil, a stimulant. They also prescribed zaleplon, basically a fast acting ambien, to take as needed for middle of the night awakenings. The modafinil helped a little with wakefulness and depression, but the insomnia persisted. At this point, I was taking modafinil and Prozac in the morning, gabapentin before bed, and zaleplon as needed in the middle of the night. I got really frustrated because the psychiatrists I would see didn’t seem to know that much on how to effectively treat chronic insomnia.

Months later I’m still depressed (with bouts of suicidal ideation)  and have pretty bad anxiety and insomnia. I ended up moving for a job and found a new sleep specialist who immediately referred me to a CBT-I therapist. CBT-I stands for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.

CBT-I gave me multiple tools to handle my insomnia. One of the first things I had to do was bed restriction, where you’re only allowed in your bed for approximately an hour less than you’d sleep in a night. I started with a 7 hour window and the therapist had me log all my sleep patterns and awakenings and each week we met she would adjust my window if my sleep efficiency was over 90%.

In CBT-I I also learned many other techniques, I guess the goal is to find the things that work for you. One I liked is constructive worry - taking 15 minutes in the day time (eg noon) to write down all your worries and what you can do about them, or if they’re out of your control. There were many other techniques that the therapist taught me as well.

I did CBT-I for 6 weeks, and my sleep improved a ton and I was even able to get off some of my medications. After 6 weeks I was down to just Prozac and modafinil, and more rarely zaleplon. Now, another 3 months later, my psychiatrist said I’m no longer in a depressive episode. I’m only still taking Prozac in the morning, and CBD as needed for sleep and anxiety. I can’t describe how relieved I am to be sleeping regularly - it truly helped in so many ways. I’ve even begun the process of slowly tapering off the Prozac so I should be free of all drugs except CBD in a couple months. I now sleep 7-9 hours a night with maybe 1 awakening that I manage with mindfulness and CBD. I find a 5:1 ratio of CBD to THC works best for me. I’m in a legal state now.

I highly recommend CBT-I if you haven’t tried it. Please feel free to ask any questions. I hope this helps and good luck to you all!",Zaleplon

208,"Your experiences and thoughts on sedative-hypnotic medications I was just curious to see what medications have worked best for other people and how you feel about the use of benzodiazapenes and/or the z-drugs for long-term use. Having had chronic insomnia for many years (basically as far back as I can remember, all the way to early childhood), I have tried pretty much every drug out there with some minor exceptions like chloral hydrate and barbiturates (also, I actually study/work in a neurobiology/psychopharmacology based field, so I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about these drugs as well!)

Just as a start, I have found that Sonata (Zaleplon), Restoril (Temazepam), and Ativan (Lorazepam) have worked best for me, with Lunesta (*es*zopiclone), Trazodone, and drugs with anti-histaminergic activity among the worst.

211,"My short term “cure” for insomnia (long post) I had a trauma occur and have had insomnia for almost year. I know that insomnia has to be up there with the worst mental conditions. 

I had a bout of insomnia with no REM and no deep sleep for a month, I felt awake the whole time and it was the worst experience of my life. I felt like my natural ability to sleep was broken and circadian rhythm was damaged beyond repair. How did I eventually get sleep? (Besides micro sleep) Along with some other things I’ll mention, I finally found a medication combo that worked which is Mirtazapine (Remeron), Temazepam/Klonopin, Melatonin, a little weed (2 hours before bedtime) and a high dose of quality CBD. Now I take tolerance breaks from these meds and my sleep is a little shaky but the meds I use on my T break is Trazodone, CBD, Weed and Magnolia Bark. I’m hoping therapy will help me ween off the meds and switch to only natural remedies. We know the risk potential with Benzos so use them only when you absolutely need them, and if you get to that point, the pros outweigh the cons. But still don’t take them daily for long periods of time.

Retraining your circadian rhythm is a big factor if you’ve gone weeks without sleep. If your circadian rhythm was so out of wack like mine I suggest you get sunlight in the morning whenever you “wake up” and caffeine early in the morning, obviously not near bed time. It tells your body this is when you should wake up. Now before you lay down to go to sleep at night, stay up as long as you possibly can before your body starts to give in, aka sleep restriction therapy, and then add in the medication. Make sure your occupying your time with fun and mellow activities during this time and minimal blue light. If you suffer from OCD tendencies or negative thought patterns I highly recommend and OTC supplement NAC to take in the daytime. One of the biggest keys is to make sure to supplement with Creatine, Vitamin BCD, Fish Oil, Magnesium, Zinc, Fiber and a TON of water as your body gets depleted of these quicker during long bouts of insomnia especially Vit B, creatine and water. Try to be as healthy as possible to counteract the negative health effects from insomnia, exercise is crutial but don’t over do it. Get really nice earplugs and therapy can really help as well. A lot of people don’t understand insomnia so having a therapist to vent about it to is helpful.

I believe 98% of peoples insomnia stems from some form of trauma in their life, or just gradually built up depression, or both. One of the most important thing I mention is to remind yourself that your insomnia is caused by the trauma and is a normal reaction to it. No need to put blame on yourself, some things are out of our control. 

Other meds I’ve tried-

Seroquel- This is a god send for some and definitely makes you tired but it’s feel weird type of tired that keeps me up. 

Trazodone- Not terrible, it works sometimes but not when anxiety is high. 

Hydroxyzine- Worked a few times then stopped.

Ambien- Works when paired with benzo be careful with doses.

Magnesium/Melatonin/CBD/Theanine- Hopefully I’ll get to a point where these are all I need but not currently.

Phenibut/Gabapentin- GABA-B antagonists give me sort of energizing feel so didn’t work well the few times I tried it. Don’t use daily.

Kratom- Really good natural remedy for depression. Don’t use daily.

Melatonin can help me get to sleep, but I wake up after a couple of hours. Unisom was great a few months ago, but has lost most of it's effectiveness.

I've also read mixed information that it has the potential to keep you awake rather than sedate you in some cases. For reference, I started on 50mg, had one sleepless night due to a mild panic attack, and bumped up to 100mg. Been on that dose for 3 weeks and I still have some sleepless nights.

I'm really just considering stopping this medication all together. Last night, after nearly dozing off without it, I jerked awake, went to take my dose, and didn't feel sedated in the least bit. I was worried I'd miss the sleep window.

tonight is my first night on ambien. I took it about 7 hours ago and for 7 hours I have laid here tossing and turning. I am going on 65-70 hours no sleep. usually I can't sleep until the fifth day, then I get a few hours and the cycle starts over.

What hit me the most was when after an hour of waking up and taking a shower, I suddenly got heavily dehydrated and had to force myself to lay on the floor to not faint for 20 minutes.

I tried contacting my doctor, however I don’t think she responds on Fridays and the weekends, so I’m unsure what to do. :( My grandparents with who I stay with are suggesting I drop it, and even though I got a lot of sleep in, I’m considering it since I never experienced this badly of sad affects before.

232,"Cycling different sleeping aids to avoid tolerance and addiction, any thoughts? I'm dealing with insomnia for a year or so, the cause is not really clear but is probably related to my bipolar disorder. I've tried several sleeping pills with mixed results. My psychiatrist will not prescribe trazodone or remeron. I've tried otc stuff like unisom and also phenergan but I tend to get terrible headaches from these. I can't use weed. 

 I'm trying to find a schedule cycling different sleeping aids. I'm hoping to avoid tolerance and addiction, and I also hope to be able to use these meds for longer periods without negative side effects. My doctor is fine with this idea. I'm hoping you can provide some more ideas. 


My schedule:

- melatonin, 1 or 2 mg, 3/4 times per week (I get maybe 5 hours of broken sleep, I wake up 3 times at least)

- quetiapine, 12,5 mg, 2 times per week (does work very well but sometimes I get a nasty next day hangover)

- restoril, 10mg., 1 time per week (works great)

- zolpidem, 5 mg., 1 time per week (I sleep for five hours and then I'm unable to get to sleep again).


I'm thinking of swapping the zolpidem for zopiclone, hoping that might work longer. 

If it wasn't addictive and if tolerance effects didn't exist then I probably would take the restoril everyday. 

Do you have any thoughts regarding this cycling of meds? Any other ideas? Thanks!",Trazodone
233,"Insomnia since childhood. Any recommendations on pajamas to mitigate continued issues? I identify as F and am 40 years old. I eat extremely healthy and am very physically active. I have had sleep issues my whole life— in fact, I can recall being in the army at 17 and not being able to sleep all night, then carrying my weapon all day (loaded at times) and thinking “this cannot be safe!”  

I was on and off of Xanax and seroquel, trazodone and ambien for the past decade. I have successfully stopped the Xanax and ambien and now only take 25 mg seroquel and 50 mg trazodone (down from 100 mg and 100 mg respectively). These two lowered dose combinations added with natural lithium supplement actually knock me out pretty solid. 

So far so good. Right? Well now I’m finding out that I wake up drenched in sweat or totally frozen. We live at 7000 feet with negative temps constantly. So I wear warm clothes to bed and leave the heat on 55. Before we get into “your hormones could be causing this” (which I’ve suspected!) my husband complains of the exact same symptoms. The issue is, he sleeps in sweats and I sleep in crappy Walmart cotton clothes. (We live extremely remotely and I just grab whatever I can at the worst store for shopping on the planet.)

So now I’m thinking we need so super high quality cotton pajamas to help keep us asleep at a consistent temp. I’m willing to pay a premium of course because sleep is so critical. Does anyone on here know of any high quality brands that are durable, soft, cotton, and breathe?

237,"Pregnant, Severe Insomnia, Having Anxiety Attacks Every Night This is my 4th pregnancy (1st ended in a loss at 8 weeks.) My first two pregnancies were like miracles. During the first trimester, I could sleep perfectly without meds for the first time since I was 17 (I’m 38 now.) My 3rd pregnancy, the effect wasn’t quite as strong, but was enough that I only needed to take 12.5 mg of Seroquel to fall asleep.

Note: All of these were for 1st trimester only. My 1st pregnancy, I was taking 25 mg Seroquel a night by the end, whereas the 3rd I was actually taking 800 mg by the end (while only prescribed 300.) During the 3rd, I also began taking Ambien in my 3rd trimester, sometimes 30 mg per night. Luckily, both babies were totally healthy and bright. (Youngest is 2 now.)

This pregnancy is totally different. I’m not even 5 weeks along, and my insomnia has gotten way, way worse instead of better. I’ve been having massive anxiety attacks every night. They make my heart pound and make me feel like I have to jump out of my skin. I thrash around in bed like a beached fish while my brain blares alarm signals at me.

Last night, I took 800 mg Seroquel, 12 mg melatonin, 4 benedryl, and 4 unisoms, then when my anxiety attack overtook me (worst one yet), I chewed up 15 mg klonopin, because at that point I cared more about stopping the anxiety than anything else in the world, including the health of my embryo. (I have a very high benzo tolerance.)

I just don’t know what to do. Other (so far unused) meds in my roster include Trazodone, Phenibut, Ambien, and Propranolol. Tonight I’m thinking of trying 500 mg Seroquel, 3 (100 mg?) Trazodone, and 20 mg Propranolol.

I just don’t know what to do without potentially harming my baby, but at this point I value my mental health higher, especially because I’m not even sure I want a 3rd kid (husband’s idea).

I was very excited yesterday morning because I dreamed - first time I’ve remembered a weirdo jacked up dream in way over a month. I actually felt human for a few hours. I had forgotten how great it felt to wake up even a little refreshed instead of defeated… I got all the way to REM! 

I decided to just try to rest for a few hours instead of the Pass/Fail exam of sleeping I’ve been doing. Instead of guided meditations I found some sleep hypnosis things on YouTube. I’d listen to one, then acknowledge that I rested a bit, maybe get up and pee, get some water, pet the cat, choose another video. I did this starting at 8:30 and around 3-4a.m. started noticing that I was feeling more “floaty” and relaxed. I liked the affirmations that I was hearing. I started repeating a few from Nick Wright (just stumbled across him). At around 6:00, I took off my headphones and suddenly WOKE from a goofy vivid dream. It was shortly after 8. So, I finally fell asleep, even if for only two hours. I was so excited. I felt almost normal again yesterday, until I got tired, but still like there has been progress. I was kind of excited to try again last night. I hadn’t taken much either, and nothing after I went to bed.

I didn’t sleep last night. I didn’t even feel trance-like or drifts last night. Wtf? It’s like I was resisting the effort. 

Tomorrow will be 8 weeks since I got a decent night’s sleep. One week ago I got a new physician, she has me taking mirtazapine 15mg plus 10mg melatonin at the same time each night. I was doing this, albeit not as regimented, I’m not overly hopeful that in 2-4 weeks I’ll begin sleeping. I’ve also used unisom, Benadryl, trazodone, seroquel, tryptophan, even ambien/zolpidem. My brain has decided to rebel against everything. The ambien worked for 5 hours of crappy sleep - for the first week. Now i don’t fall asleep on any of it.

I don’t know why my brain is fighting sleep so bad. I’m exhausted. I love sleep. There is no joy in telling anyone I still didn’t sleep. Sleep has become unfamiliar. I’m having a very hard time being kind to myself. I don’t understand why I’m “overthrowing” everything. I’m so frustrated. This weekend I tried to accept that this is more than likely psychological.

I developed onset insomnia that progressive got worse. This went on for weeks with maybe a couple hours a night. It got it my head. I couldn't stop thinking about sleep. I knew how important sleep was and the harder I tried to sleep the less I slept. My primary care gave me trazodone that made everything worse. I ended up going 5 days with ZERO sleep. I was suffering, working full time and coming home to take care of a baby. On the fifth day I went to the ER and they said there is nothing that can be done. I never felt so hopeless. My entire body was weak. I lost 10 pounds. I was failing at my new job, my wife didn't want me to watch the baby anymore. Then I made the biggest mistake of my life. I attempted suicide but could not go through with it. I called my wife and then she called 911. I was taken to a psychiatric hospital. At the hospital I was told that I have an imbalance that is easily treatable with anxiety / depression medicine. Surely enough, I began sleeping again immediately. 

PLEASE don't make the same mistake I made. Now I have to rebuild my life after a suicide attempt. I'm lucky to still be alive. I'm lucky that my wife still wants to be with me. Beating insomnia on your own is living torture. Your primary care cannot help you. Please go see a physiatrist asap. Sleeping is a natural ability that 99 percent of the world has no issues with.

Unfortunately, I started getting a strange rash that appears about 30 minutes after I take my Seroquel, so we’re thinking I’ve developed an intolerance to it or something.

- Did you have these side effects, and did they ever go away?

I’ll get the obvious / obligatory sleep hygiene comment out of the way : 

Wake up at the same time even if  you didn’t sleep well and go to bed at the same time , no matter what. 

1:When you wake up , go outside in the sun. If it’s cold out, even better.
 I run around my neighborhood in nothing but shorts for 20 minutes or so , walk the last 10.  Do not wear sunglasses and try to get as much direct sunlight in your eyes without actually staring at the sun ☀️. Even if it’s cloudy out you’ll still get a lot of light

* Optionally before you go outside do a couple rounds of the Wim Hof breathing exercise. I always do it but it might not be good for everyone. 


2 After , take a cold shower or an ice bath. Start slow(!!!) and work yourself up to longer durations. I have a stock tank in my back yard  that I keep filled in the winter and empty it every couple weeks so it doesn’t get gross. You can easily fill a bathtub with ice and cold water and do the same, or just set the shower to all the way cold. Try to work up to 10 minutes or so.

3. Do not end with a warm shower. Let your body warm itself up naturally. 



I have successfully ended spells of insomnia ,  and kicked weed / trazodone multiple times doing this with 0 insomnia. I’m also prescribed adderall and I have 0 insomnia on it if I do this protocol before taking my medicine. Yes, it can suck. No, it’s not suitable for everyone. But I’ve come to enjoy it quite a lot though over the years. It gives you a ton of energy first thing in the morning. The direct sunlight combined with the hormetic  stress will set your clock and create a huge energy demand on your body to warm you back up.  

Sounds crazy , works really well. No exogenous drugs required , not that I have anything against meds / drugs . Just thought I’d share cause not sleeping is the worst.  Hope it’s helpful to someone 🤷‍♂️

TLDR:  basically Wim Hof method + strict bed and wake time.",Trazodone
253,"Trazodone seems safe to take forever, so why do people wean off? My concern is why do some people drop this drug? It's the only drug I've researched that seems to offer nothing really bad about it except for morning grogginess and erection problems. Why not take this pill for 2, 5, 10 years.. or even for life? It looks far better than weed on the studies I've seen.",Trazodone
254,"Trazodone and alcohol Hi guys, I've started taking trazodone to ""cure"" my insomnia and was just wondering the effects of mixing trazodone with alcohol.

Can you share with me your stories? Or what you usually do when you drink alcohol? Should I just skip trazodone the night that I drink?

I'm currently taking 50mg before bed.

Thanks!",Trazodone
255,"Good morning from someone who has not slept 😵‍💫 I took zquil, trazodone, and two hydroxyzine and I’m more awake then ever …it’s 5am here and I’ve been up all night….I’ve give up 🥲",Trazodone
256,"Experiences with trazodone? They put me on Ambien in my late teens and it worked great, but eventually it didn't seem like a great idea to just keep taking it forever. Just this week they sent me trazodone... I took it night before last at about 9pm and was up until 2:30. I took it again last night at 8pm thinking it had to work this time, but I was up until 3:45 am. My kids get up before 7 and the majority don't nap, so... Yeah... Very bad. I haven't felt this awful since high school. I can feel the trazodone (kind of feels like a brick inside my head, and a little bit like being drunk/sick?), but it didn't make me sleep.

 So now I'm kind of afraid to take it. Does it sometimes take a little bit to start working? I remember Ambien not working the first night and then working like a bulldozer for the rest of ever. What are your experiences? Should I give up on it?",Trazodone
257,"A different type of insomnia 
I can usually fall asleep just fine, but I will wake up after 2-3 hours and not be able to fall back asleep. I used to (keyword here) be able to function on those 2-3 hours. Now I’m getting older and I’m desperately needing more than that.

I recently started seeing a psychiatrist who put me on trazodone 50mg in addition to other meds. It worked great for the first 2 weeks, I’d sleep 8-9 hours and feel rested. But now I’m back in that cycle of fall asleep easy then wake up a couple hours later. Is it possible to have built up a tolerance that quickly?

I take the trazodone at the same time everyday, my bedtime only varies by about 30 minutes (usually between 9-9:30). I have an appointment with my psych the week of Christmas but I’m hoping that someone with experience using trazodone might have some insight.",Trazodone

I dropped down from 100 to 50mg usually split into two doses during the night and didnt have problems...did that over a few months. Now I think I that I'm cutting up the tablets into such small doses that I may be tapering too quickly. Trying to adjust back up a bit. I've heard about a 10% rule.

Anyone want to share their experiences getting off this shit? I have been on it for about 8-9 years.",Trazodone
260,"Took trazodone and ended up only having four hours to sleep. How do I recover? I'm not having my usual insomnia problems right now (usually it's hormonal and happens at certain points in my cycle), but my kids took turns waking each other up until after midnight last night, which really triggered my insomnia anyway. I took trazodone and fell asleep pretty promptly, but my two year old woke up crying twice more, and all three were up for the day at like 6:30 as usual. In the end I only got four hours. I feel like there's a brick inside my head. What do you do to pull yourself together when this happens? It's been a long time since I've been on prescription sleep aids. Back then there used to be this awesome thing called ""sleeping in"" you could maybe do if you didn't get enough sleep... There was also this thing called a nap 😅 Unfortunately those things no longer exist, so I need something other than supplementary sleep.",Trazodone
261,"I'm not sure if im sleeping or not and its really freaking me out. Hello, I have been dealing with really bad anxiety the past few months and my sleep has not been great but the past 3 or so days has been really bad (I think?). I will lay in bed with my eyes closed trying to sleep and it kinda feels like im just laying there. The only thing that makes me think I slept is that I recall having a dream and the fact that I dont feel too bad other than the anxiety. I was prescribed trazodone when this all started but I stayed off it because the side affects freaked me out. I think i'm gonna take it tonight... I just am worried because in animal studies the animals died after like 2 weeks without sleep.",Trazodone

He said to try imipramine but I can’t find much about this med online.  I’m it seems like it’s similar to trazadone which didn’t work well for me.  I also hear there could be some bad side effects.",Trazodone
263,"I am on 20mg olanzapine (overdose and take 30mg), 1.5mg risperidone, 90mg mianserin, 75mg clomipramine, 2mg clonazepam and 150mg trazadone - and I still wake up multiple times throughout the night I have progressively worsening insomnia since August 2019. In July 2019 I found it harder to fall asleep and remain asleep. In August 2019 I went 5 days without sleep and went to the emergency department in my country's hospital.  

They referred me to the country's mental asylum (which is officially the worst mental health hospital in all of Europe - google the name ""mount carmel hospital malta"") and they started me on 7.5mg olanzapine. That knocked me out for 8 hours straight. But it was not to last. My insomnia got worse and worse and I soon found out I had the complete and total inability to feel sleepy. I have no sleep drive. I haven't felt sleepy since August 2019.  

Every 3 months, my insomnia worsens, like clockwork. It got worse 2 days ago. In the past this wasn't an issue, because my doctor would just increase the dosage of the olanzapine by 5mg (olanzapine  and mianserin seem to be the two medications that seems to do anything, the others I consider ""cosmetic"").  

But now I am on the maximum prescribable dose of olanzapine and I can't fall asleep anymore. I have illegally bought a couple of boxes of olanzapine so I can overdose to 30mg (the government gives me all of my medication for free but dispenses exact amounts for every two months, except for the trazodone, which I have to buy).  

I earn very little and olanzapine is an expensive medication, as is trazodone, but those are the least of my worries. In another 2-3 months time my insomnia will progress again and I will be sleepless for good!

Is there anyone out there that has insomnia that ""progresses""? Is there anyone out there with absolutely no natural sleep-drive?",Trazodone
264,"Remeron/Mirtazapine question Not my typical shitpost on this account.  Just at the end of my rope really.  I've struggled with insomnia my whole life, been off and on meds throughout the years, have an official diagnosis, but still am having problems.  This year my insomnia has become the worst it's ever been.  This has also been the most stressful year to date.  I've been sick since February and have been diagnosed with IBS, still getting it fully under control.  Realized I'm likely on the spectrum and am on a waitlist for testing.  Almost lost my condo and was forced to sell and come clean to everyone in my life about financial difficulties (since resolved through sale of the condo, even bought a house to live in).  My sleep disturbances have gotten significantly worse throughout all of this, and we're on medication 5 to try and get this under control.  So far I'm not happy with it.  


So far, we've tried Trazodone, Lunesta, Nortriptyline, Doxepin, and now we're on Remeron/Mirtazapine.  It's not helping me sleep at all.  I wake up feeling tired and unmotivated (GP just increased me from 15mg to 30mg on the Remeron to help with this), and even with my ADHD medications I'm starting to have issues concentrating at work again.  I have no motivation to do anything, I haven't been able to unpack boxes sitting in my garage for the last month even though they annoy me.    I sleep maybe 3-4 hours a night, I fall asleep around 4am and wake up at 6:30am and if I can fall back asleep I wake up around 9:30 - 10am.  I have immense trouble getting out of bed.  My GP is convinced this is all related to anxiety, and that with the right dosage of Remeron that this will all go away.  While my anxiety is less than it was it's still there.   I feel like a shell of the person I used to be.  I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything really other than apathy.   GP says I need to stick this out and since we've seen ""some improvement even if I can't see it"" and once my brain chemistry balances out I'll be better, but I just feel like I'm getting worse / am not myself.  At this point the only thing that's keeping me sane at night is dabs and watching Star Trek.   Is this normal for Remeron or do I need to request a new medication?  


(To those who might ask, I've tried CBT-I that I could find online, adjusting my sleep hygiene, no phones, no screen time for hours before bed, melatonin, cbd, nearly everything OTC and natural and nothing has helped)",Trazodone
265,"For the past two weeks or so my nights have felt sleepless... I've started a program for CBT-I over the past few days and while I did get medicine that helped me for two days the problem came back even though I kept taking it.

Anyway, last night I hopped into bed all tired and excited to sleep, I've been trying to keep all the anxiety and stress seperated from my bedroom and take care of it somewhere else when I wake up in the middle of the night. But it's still hard that once I hit my head on the pillow all these thoughts come rustling into my head and my anxiety kicks in (even though I take Alprazolam 0.25mg and Trazodone 100mg as my doctor told me) and it is still pretty much the same. I don't feel tired during the day despite how poor and upsetting to me my sleep has been. I don't really feel like my health is being affected negatively but when it's the middle of the night and you're wide awake and you just want to sleep, it really takes a toll on me mentally. I feel like I could have been asleep without realizing it, but as it stands it just feels like I was never actually getting any shuteye at all last night. Like the way my brain interprets it is that I was awake the entire night, but I do not feel tired or sleepy today at all.  I've had similar experiences like this in the past, but never one that lasted 2 weeks like this. Those went away after I had decided to just stop stressing over how much I was actually sleeping, choosing to trust my body that it knows what it needs and letting my anxiety go, which had completely stopped the midnight awakenings. But like I said it has come back when there was one trigger that brought my anxiety back, and that's where I am at now, trying to have trust in my body again and that it knows what it needs and that it will take care of me, but my point is that I just am feeling so defeated and crushed and sad when I am awake in the middle of the night that it becomes really hard to deal with.",Trazodone
266,"Trazodone suddenly working too well? I was prescribed 50mg of trazodone several months ago but it wasn't quite working, so my doctor bumped me up to 100mg. I was still waking up in the middle of the night every other day or so, but it was working pretty well. 

Then one day something changed and taking 100mg had me asleep for 11 hours, so I dropped back to 50mg and had the same problem.

267,"Insomnia - any diagnoses besides anxiety/depression ? I’m so frustrated right now, it’s been five weeks since I’ve slept decent. And it wasn’t great before that. I’ve been working with my psychologist on everything since this started the first week of November, and three weeks later she had me contact my primary doctor because she can’t find a psychiatric reason. The primary care doctor met with me virtually. He has not been helpful, and it’s obvious from his notes that he is not considering this is anything but psychiatric problems, even though I’ve given him all the info from the psychologist. After zero results with his various trazodone, seroquel, and mirtazepine combinations. I finally got angry Friday on the phone and told his nurse that I need help and I don’t feel like they are listening to me. I hadn’t been able to even fall asleep at all the two nights previous. (“Cut the trazodone dose in half” was the last grand gesture from him).

That evening I picked up a prescription of zolpidem / ambien. I’ve been sleeping about 5-6 hours the past four nights using that, but I’m still exhausted. And once I wake at 3:00-4:00 I can’t get back to sleep. I’ve been unable to nod off and take a nap since this began five weeks ago.

My psychologist is frustrated because she feels this warrants at least basic lab tests. I’ve asked three times for a referral to a specialist and they’ve ignored me. I’m frustrated and tired. I sent an update yesterday, that I’m taking the ambien, sleeping about five hours, I’m not well rested. 
I would like a plan. A nurse wrote back with “you need to cut out caffeine and not use screens before bedtime”. I’m so pissed. I’ve been working on this for five weeks and I’m well beyond this advice! 

I know they won’t continue to prescribe ambien… and that they’ll implement drug testing if I want more. Yet, their message with the prescription was that it’s to get me enough rest so *I* can figure it out. Ffs! 

I just want to add that I’m not opposed to using psych meds, if I need them. I took various combinations for over 20 years, for better and worse. I’ve got a psychologist saying I don’t need them and a family doctor who wants me on high seroquel for insomnia. I think i need a new physician.",Trazodone

269,"Don't know if I fell asleep Hi, this is my first post ever. Sorry if it's long.
I've been suffering from insomnia for 3 years now, I'm 24. 
It all started when I stayed up for nights on end with a horrible fear of not falling asleep. My parents didn't want my doctor to prescribe me sleeping meds, they only gave in when I hit the 4th night of no sleep. The doc finally gave me En (delorazepam) and I slept fine.
Fast forward to now, eventually En stopped working and now I'm on Trazodone and a bunch of other meds to treat my depression (only started taking these last year).
The fear of falling asleep has finally subsided and I'm not as anxious as I used to be, but when I get to bed, I take my Trazodone, I'm tired and ready and then... I open my eyes exactly 4-5hrs later and I just KNOW I haven't slept. My eyes burn like hell and my mind is surprisingly alert.
When I do sleep, I always dream (mostly horrible vivid nightmares, but better than not sleeping) and I feel groggy.
Other times my mind can't seem to shut up and it just makes up conversations I could have with someone else in my head and other random things. I get so caught up and focused on these that I don't fall asleep.
But what about when I'm all relaxed and I still FEEL that I haven't fallen asleep? It's like I'm _surface sleeping_. Very hard to explain. I don't notice the passing of time, but I'm still kind of alert of my surroundings.

273,"Insomnia Since 6th Grade hehe story time Hi my fellow insomniacs!

I've just joined the community as I completely forgot that reddit has a place for everyone.

This is my intro post that will be a rant/advice/hopeless search for understanding in the endless nights we're all familiar with.

My chronic insomnia started about 10 years ago when I gradually became unable to fall asleep- maybe sooner because I was always unable to nap as a child. Around age 12 I remember just staring out into my dark room for hours before going to class in the morning- but weirdly enough I was never really tired. Exhausted? yes. Tired? never. A year later I began seeing a psychiatrist after my brother started being seen for his ADD. She quickly prescribed me Seroquel accompanied by 1 mg Xanax... kinda interesting as a first resort for a middle schooler upon further reflection, but I digress. Two years later I had matured and realized hmm... 'I kinda don't wanna be addicted to Xanax before I can even drive' and decided to quit cold turkey. I had a day or two of withdrawal effects and continued on my journey. I then tried Belsomra which typically worked pretty well until my insurance stopped paying for it. I then tried a few other things and landed on Trazodone (100 mg) which works most nights and doesn't give me the underlying feeling that I'm an addict. Ambien also works but I think it's not recommended long-term so I only use it when the Trazodone doesn't. In between I've tried some natural remedies, OTC sleep drugs, obviously lots of Melatonin, exercise, and meditation. Nothing works. Without my medication I would honestly never sleep. I've even tried to exhaust myself into sleep, but unsurprisingly that also doesn't work. The only non-drug that sometimes works is actually Headspace Sleepcasts, though I usually listen to them when the Trazodone doesn't work so I'm already primed. My thoughts are always racing and my brain only takes a break when it's numbed by medication... sigh.

I've already read a few posts from some of y'all with chronic insomnia and it makes me feel less alone. I don't have anyone who can relate to the absolute fury I have when people ask if I've tried Melatonin or Benadryl/doctors ask if it's my sinuses or RLS- thank you for being my people who finally understand.

If you have a story like mine and have any suggestions/advice/rants please feel free to share :)

278,"insomnia and narcolepsy This may be a weird question but, can you have both?

I posted a bit ago asking about falling asleep during the day and having false awakenings

&#x200B;

I saw my psychiatrist today about this, and she mentioned narcolepsy and non-24. She said to follow up with the people who did my sleep study. The more I look into narcolepsy the more everything I experience makes sense. But I also cannot sleep at all at night w/o my Ambien and trazodone. Even ON it I barely can. And I have delayed REM at night, according to my sleep doctors who did the sleep study. So I'm not sure what to think. Non-24 doesn't really seem to make sense to me with what I experience. Insomnia and Narcolepsy \*do\*. But I'm no doctor.

So again, can you have both? is there some disorder that I don't know about that causes you to experience both these things? Do one of these cover all my symptoms? I'm very confused xD

Just laid there both nights with weird, racing thoughts. Tuesday after work I went to the doctor and he gave me seven days worth of Trazodone.

I'm currently trying to change my insomnia medication because my current setup is no longer working. Currently, I take Seroquel 400mg & Trazodone 300mg at bedtime. They are not traditional insomnia meds, but they can be used for that. Even doubling the doses worked for a short time, but now it no longer does.    


So I'm on some medications for my fibromyalgia (hydros, muscle relaxers & gabapentin), as well as monthly CGRP injections for my migraines (Emgality).

285,"This fucking sucks I’ve been dealing with a bout of insomnia for about a week now and it’s driving me insane. I’m prescribe 175 mg of Trazodone for sleep but I guess it isn’t working anymore. I’m so mad because I went for such a long time getting nice sleep and now I’m not. It’s beginning to interfere with my school.

I hate insomnia so much. It’s taken so much away from me. I’ve been dealing with it off and on for years now. Once my insomnia got so bad, I had to drop out of school. What if I have to do that again? I would be a failure to so many around me.

I feel like crying this is so frustrating. I’m physically tired but can’t seem to shut my brain off. Insomnia ruins my days before they even begin. 

If anyone has tips on how to get even just some sleep that would be awesome. Sometimes I’m tempted to get a rag soaked with chloroform and just knocking myself out but that can’t be good for you.",Trazodone
286,"This fucking sucks Man I hate insomnia so much. I’ve started having a bout of it again starting 4 days ago after sleeping really well for a really long time. I have to get up today at 5 am and I didn’t sleep last night neither. I’m prescribed 175 mg Trazodone for sleep but I guess it hasn’t been working. This is beginning to interfere with school and it’s making me cry.

I’ve been dealing with insomnia on and off for years now. Once my insomnia got so bad that I had to drop out of college. I hate this so much. Insomnia takes so much away from me, it ruins my days before it even begins.

287,"There’s gotta be something wrong with me Right now I just took ashwaghanda, chamomile, magnesium glycinate, and valerian root. I feel chill but still can’t sleep. This is after getting two hours of sleep the previous night. 

I’ve also tried melatonin in prescription strengths, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants, and hydroxyzine. Only thing that has ever worked is a benzo but that’s not sustainable.",Trazodone
288,"The GF doesn't understand that I have no sleep reflex I'm having a really rough time, guys. I got my third shot on Sunday and feel like garbage, and my shipment of Seroquel never made it to my door. And I can't just go to the doctor because I live in a different state from the state that I'm insured in because I'm on my parents insurance and there's no way in hell I'd ever be able to afford insurance. 

She doesn't understand why I'm pissed and says I don't know I won't sleep without it but I do. No less than 300mg puts me under. I don't have a sleep reflex without medication. I know because I've gone 4 days wide awake without it. I was about to go to the emergency room. 

I told her it's like being stressed because you're in a desert with no water but she doesn't get it. She's so into bandaid fixes for serious issues some reason and she thinks some sort of therapy will help, but that doesn't help me tonight. 

I used to be on 300mg of Seroquel, 45mg of Remeron, 30mg of Temazepam, and 20mg of Melatonin and still had trouble sleeping. I even switched to Seroquel from Trazodone because I maxed it out and it still wasn't helping. The fact that I only need 300mg of Seroquel and 30mg of Remeron and a Benedryl was a massive fucking achievement to me. 

No I don't want to do sleep restriction, that sounds like literal hell. Like chemo that kills the patient. I've worked hard to fix my sleep schedule then one errant task, one thing I need to do at 10pm because I forgot, one night of doing things I haven't had time to do destroys it all in one night. I've only ever gotten as far as  7:45 before I gave up. 

Nobody understands man. I'm not lying awake because I'm worried about the big meeting tomorrow, I'm lying awake because I lack the reflex to go to sleep myself. I know because one random day I stopped sleeping without meds and haven't slept without meds or anesthetic ever since.

No I don't live an unhealthy life, don't even type it. I don't drink anything that's not water or tea, don't smoke anything, exercise 3-5 times a week, get outside every day, and meditate regularly.",Trazodone

I've been on it for around a year now, (started at 50mg - 100 mg - 150mg), and within the past week it's lost all its effect on me. Like, I just took 200mg around 5 hours ago and I'm still awake. I've even just been lying in bed. Anyone else have this experience? It used to work like a dream, knock me out within an hour of taking it. I don't want to increase to like 250mg, since I always feel groggy the first few hours of waking up. Plus, it makes me so fucking hungry.",Trazodone

291,"Insomnia started a few weeks ago and I've been too scared to sleep Ended up in a behavioral hospital because of it since I have health anxiety too and was prescribed Seroquel and gabapentin.  Trazodone and hydroxyzine only as needed.  

I just feel absolutely defeated and I'm still getting some sleep but not anything good.  I start getting anxious as it gets darker in the day, but luckily the gabapentin stops the attacks mostly.   Last night I swore I woke like 4 times, but I know I slept since I vaguely remember a few dreams.  There's moments in the day I worry I have fatal insomnia, but I know that's nothing new being heard in insomnia communities since insomnia can make us anxious about everything.

I've had moments in my life where insomnia will hit me like a truck, but they're foggy memories so it feels like this is completely new when probably I've already experienced this exact same feeling years ago.  

This is mostly just a vent, but was also wondering if anyone else feels similar and is also scared to sleep every night? :(",Trazodone
292,"Finally Today was my long awaited first visit ever (f55) with a psychiatrist.
I really needed a PTSD diagnosis along with anxiety/depression/insomnia.
She made me feel better just knowing there are options and that today I will begin a new medication regime and stop letting my (loved) PCP give me ambien and Xanax.  It's so much more than that for me.
I will go next month for a medication check and have a new therapist with this practice.

293,Trazodone and OTC sleep aides Anyone here take trazodone nightly for sleep and have some nights where it just doesn’t work? Wondering if others have taken the trazodone at bedtime and then a few hours later try something over the counter like Zzzquil or melatonin or unisom?,Trazodone

No matter what I try to take or do I still lay awake all night until 6am and then sleep until 8 or 9 if I am lucky. But even when I do sleep I can’t stop waking up. I stay off of my phone and play white noise and have my room really dark. I take seroquel every night and at first it was making me tired but now it doesn’t. I just don’t know what else I can try.",Trazodone
295,"Is it even worth doing a sleep study? What can they even learn that would help? So, I have been sleeping poorly pretty much all my life- the last time I remember sleeping through a whole night without any restlessness was when I was a kid.  It's been worse recently though.  I fall asleep OK, but on a good night I'm awake every 1.5 hours and on a bad night I only sleep in 30-45 minute bits, with a lot of frustration falling back to sleep between cycles.

I'm a little discouraged from seeking help though because I don't see many options for a treatment that would actually work for me.  I've tried various self- medication options, and a couple of the ""real"" sleep-aids, not had any results.  I was prescribed Ambien once a long time ago when I was also on Wellbutrin and the doctor gave me the Ambien pre-emptively because apparently wellbutrin can cause poor sleep- it was great the first night I tried it but nearly useless after that.  I tried Trazodone just one night (got it from a friend, not prescribed) and that was useless, don't know if it would be any better if I took it consistently.  I tried cannabis (half a gummy of CBN/THC blend) and felt terrible and didn't help me stay asleep at all.  I've tried all kids of herbals and melatonin and crap but none seem to help except lavender oil, and that's only a small improvement.  Can't take much now anyway because I'm pregnant.  Pretty sure I don't have sleep apnea- I'm skinny and don't snore, and already am a side sleeper.

The other problem is that I have a night job.  Partly due to my naturally broken sleep schedule, I figured if I was going to be up all hours of the night anyway I might as well get paid for it.  I work overnight ER veterinary medicine, and usually get to sleep some at work because we're most often not busy enough to keep me running all night.  During this time, I can't be taking any sleep aids that would impair me.  At home, I also don't want to take anything that would leave me impaired if I had to wake up, because I have young kids and they might need things at night (also new baby coming who will definitely need things at night).  I practice some parts of sleep hygiene like keeping the bedroom darkened and only using bed for sleep/sex, but keeping a regular routine and schedule is basically impossible without changing my entire life around.

I live in the glorious US of A, and my insurance deductible is $5k, so I'm reluctant to go consult with a sleep professional unless I have some real hope that I'm not just wasting my money for them to shrug and prescribe me something I can't use.  I'm posting here looking for stories of people who got useful information from a sleep study or doctor/sleep expert that actually helped them and gave them info they could not have gotten from the internet.

TL:DR- please tell me how a sleep specialist doctor was actually helpful in a way that made them worth the money.",Trazodone
296,"Anyone take anything to help them sleep LONGER? Hey y’all. I’ve been struggling with terrible insomnia for years that was helped with mirtazepine but stopped working when my other meds for depression stopped working (it’s ✨treatment resistant✨). I’ve only been able to get 2-4 hours of sleep (it’s REALLY HARD to fall asleep) since April and I’m going crazy. When i wake up im fully awake like too awake - I could jump out of bed and run a block. 
 
I had a sleep study done and everything was normal, the doc said I’m likely very hyper aware during light state sleep and therefore don’t feel rested + sleeping short durations but she isn’t worried (I am though bc I’m too irritable & foggy to function)

I’ve tried ramelteon (awful shortness of breath and no sleep), ambien & benzos (developed a paradoxical rxn to z-drugs/benzos-agitated depression), lunesta, sonata, elavil, seroquel (did not knock me out and literally made me feel like a groggy shell of a human), trazodone (nope). Olanzepine (only 4 hours and terrible side effects), Geodon. Going to try belsomra but I’m worried bc I haven’t heard much good about it esp for people with coocurring mental health stuff. 

I’m practicing sleeep hygiene, too.

297,"anyone here recovered but have rebound insomnia hit you randomly? Trazodone literally cured my insomnia, ok well not exactly cure, but it made my sleep almost back to pre-insomnia.

But the rebound hits you when you least expect it lmao. Ill give you 3 examples.

After i came off Trazodone i got rebound insomnia almost immidiately. For 2-3 days i had trouble falling asleep (took me till 4-5AM). After 3 days, the rebound went away and i started sleeping normally again without Trazodone. After 2 weeks, I had 2 nights where rebound hit me, i started to worry, but it went away.

Example 2:
2 months later, I went on a speed boat with my family. I had land sickness and i got rebound. Day 1, couldnt sleep bc my head was spinning in circles. Day 2: Couldn't fall asleep at all till 4-5AM. Day 3: Things slowly to get better. After a week i was back to normal.

Example 3 *currently* 
This could be my fault. IDK. I was watching fatal insomnia videos on youtube just to see idk why...i was curious. I saw a youtuber who died from neuropathy (he basically had fatal insomnia without the gene, it was caused by CIPRO - antibiotic drug) and i was thinking about it kind of...but i brushed it off. 2 days later, I went to bed per usual, but i couldnt fall asleep. I slept for 1 hour. Idk why, and i got scared ngl. I felt like i was panicking bc of those youtube videos?? A day later, I got 3 hours of sleep after waking up multiple times at night. So theres an improvement. And here we are today..

Anyways, does anyone have anything similar to me?

Without rebound hitting me, i sleep 7-10 hours daily",Trazodone
298,"The only thing that worked for me Hey everyone, I created this account in the hopes that I might get the message out to someone who is struggling like I was. Also hoping to prevent anyone from trying CBT-i as it was the worst thing to ever happen to me. If you have insomnia, stop everything, go out and buy the book Set It & Forget It by Daniel Erichsen - I got the e-book and it literally changed my life (slept 6 hours the night after reading). For good measure, get NATTO (same author) too. At its worst, my insomnia was so bad I was sleeping 1, 2 hours a night, having massive panic attacks, obsessing about sleep all day long. My anxiety manifested as a weird drunken dizziness and I became (ironically) bed ridden for a week. I have tried literally everything you can think of - acupuncture, melatonin, valerian, Zoloft, trazodone, zopiclone, olanzapine, chiropractors, meditation, yoga, naturopaths, CBT-i, teas, hot baths, exercise, low carb, high carb, eating before bed, CBD, avoiding food for hours before bed, a hush blanket, ear plugs, eye masks literally everything - I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing on this list. (spoiler - this is the problem! It will only make your insomnia worse)

He runs an online coaching program and I worked with him for 8 weeks - but literally every piece of information he has is available for free on his YouTube channel. He also answers every question personally in the comments section. If you're freaked out right now, know that there is a way out! My insomnia started as maintenance, then turned into crazy adrenaline rushes, hypnic jerks, twitches, chest pain, heart palpitations, crazy anxiety as I mentioned before, then difficulty falling asleep and probably other variations I'm forgetting. I promise you it will get better and you will sleep again!

I think I need some help on my mindset maybe? What helps you stay committed to trying to sleep in a given bad night?",Trazodone
304,"Screaming in my sleep Around the last week or two I started screaming in my sleep. Sometimes it’ll be during a nightmare. I’ll become vaguely aware that I’m in a dream and try to scream in real life, but I can’t move. Eventually I’ll fall fully back into the dream, then the cycle repeats. Many times during a nightmare I’ll try to wake myself up but I don’t have the physical power to move or wake up. So I’ll be stuck in the nightmare scene, or stuck in that half conscious phase when you can barely peek your eyes open and can’t move. Then I fall fully back asleep. Usually there’s lots of thrashing. While I can’t do fine movements like open my mouth or my wrist, feet, fingers etc. I can sometimes jerk an entire limb a little bit if I use a lot of energy

Sometimes I randomly just scream and I don’t remember any nightmare, just screaming. Sometimes it’s words like “no” or “help” but usually it’s just noise. My mom remarked that I was screaming a lot when I napped today but I only remember screaming once, so I guess there’s times when I’m screaming and I’m not aware at all.


Maybe five years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Also with insomnia, but my psychiatrist said it’s most likely caused by the anxiety and depression. I’ve been on many antidepressants and a few sleep aids. Prozac, Luvox, lexapro. Didn’t work. Currently on around 200 something Effexor and something near the recommended max dose for Wellbutrin. I don’t feel like they’re doing much either.

I used to take melatonin to fall asleep, but it wouldn’t keep me asleep. I used to wake up almost every hour of the night for ten minutes or so. So I was prescribed trazodone as well to keep me asleep. 

Eventually I could stay asleep and only wake up once or twice. I stopped with the sleeping meds. No matter what dose, I always felt like I got some kickback from trazodone the morning after. No matter what I took, or how much I slept, sleep has almost never felt restful. I’m always exhausted, I fall asleep during lectures, and I often need to nap during the day to have any energy

Every few weeks I’ll have a burst of days in a row where I’ll have vivid nightmares. Sometimes they’re recurring or have continuing plots, sometimes related to real life, sometimes just an immense fear and panic sensation.

I’ve screamed in my sleep a handful of times randomly in the past year. But now it’s nightly. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s exhausting and it takes so much energy to try to wake myself up. 

I feel fear and dread every time I need to head to bed. My cat sleeps with me and I have a weighted blanket which is comforting but it’s still so scary. 

These days I can’t fall asleep until 2-4 am. I’ll wake up anytime between 8-11 am. I just don’t know how to cope anymore",Trazodone

She told me to cut the Trazodone in half the first few times and well I’m stupid and thought since I take over the counter sleep aids on a pretty regular basis, I just took a 50mg, went to shower, and when I didn’t feel sleepy and still pretty anxious I took another 50mg for a total of 100mg my first time.

307,"Is feeling wide awake all the time normal? So back in august of this year, I had my first panic attack out of nowhere. I was up playing games all night like I've always done and it just hit me like a brick and went to the ER out of fear. After they told me I was fine and I'm just anxious they sent me back home where for the next 3 days I had heart palpitations and the moment I felt like I was about to drift to sleep it felt like ny brain and heart wpuld tingle and jolt me awake but I was still able to sleep 7 hrs those nights until eventually on the 4th day. Where it felt like I was no longer tired. And I usually had to force myself asleep getting 1-2hrs a night. Went to my doctor about it and he diagnosed me with insomnia and he gave me Hydroxyzine to try first (Didnt work) then he gave me Trazodone 50mg (Worked for 1 night but no longer after even upto 150mg) and also tried ambien and then he requested I get a sleep study done in case I was sleeping more than I thought I was. And an MRI and an EEG. (Fast forwarding to now) my MRI came back normal. (Never got the results for my EEG oddly enough I should ask about that) and the sleep study came back with saying I have Moderate OSA with 22AHI.

I went to my psychiatrist again and something is not right me with me for sure. Worst thing that happened and this is the first time I experienced it in my life was the rewind and repetition after my alcoholic episode.   
I went to sleep and heard the conversation of everyone that night. My mind could not shut up, it was a scary moment. Basically, hearing voices of colleagues in your head what they were saying that night. Unreal experience.  
Psychiatrist believes that my insomnia is secondary and that I'll solve it once we find the right diagnosis which will follow with right medication. He gave trazodone, did nothing. Mirtazapine was working but with too many sides.

313,"Low dose Mirtazapine or low dose Trazodone for better sleep? A couple months back my normally fragile, but okay, sleep started getting worse and worse, and I started spiraling into a dark depressive episode.

I think it might have been caused by the high dose inositol regimen ~18-24 grams per day that I had been taking over the summer to try and treat my PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction). I think the high dose of inositol messed something up, because my sleep has been wrecked, and I’m now an anxious and depressed mess most of the day.

Previously, I just lived with a constant low grade depression in the background, largely due to my PSSD.

Anywho, I’m at the point where I am desperate for sleep. Usually falling asleep isn’t the problem, but my sleep is very broken, and I’m usually wide awake by 4-4:30am and feel very wired.

I already take melatonin, the OTC antihistamines aren’t very helpful, I’ve tried hydroxyzine and low dose doxepin to no avail. Those latter two seemed to make things actually worse, as in made it impossible to fall asleep. Ambien is so so, but I don’t want to become dependent.

315,"Getting off 0.5mg of Ativan. Any suggestions? 

I’ve been taking 37.5 mg of trazodone since beginning of year for trouble sleeping which works semi okay, but end of may I got a concussion and developed post concussion syndrome with terrible anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and inability to cope. My doctor was reluctant to put me on a long term antidepressant so he said to just take Ativan as needed and gave me 90 pills. I began taking half a mg of it at bedtime with the trazodone and it helped ease my crying/anxiety and get some rest although it wasn’t always super great. My doctor told me it was fine to continue taking it daily. Long story short my post concussion syndrome did not get better and 4 months later I kept having panic and meltdowns and couldn’t take it anymore. So I saw a neuropsychiatrist who told me to get off the Ativan because it can inhibit cognitive repair and replace it with zopiclone right away (otherwise I’ll get withdrawal)until he starts me on an antidepressant Mirtazapine ( can’t start yet since he has to notify my doctor etc), after which point the goal is to stop having anxiety and stop taking sleeping pills as he thinks my anxiety is the cause of my insomnia. This all freaks me out as I’m super worried to go from one addiction to the next. I had no idea I would get withdrawal symptoms from half a mg of Ativan, it didn’t even work all that amazingly for sleep. So a part of me just wants to wean off of it stay on the trazodone at bedtime and wait for the antidepressant to begin in 2 weeks. Any suggestions of how to get off of it and not make myself feel much worse? I can’t ask this guy again because that appointment was only one consultation session then he passes me back to my family doctor (who is kind of useless).",Trazodone

The combination of zolpidem with promethazine usually works, but not always. And sometimes, even after 8 hours of sleep, I feel like I wasn't sleeping at all! In the morning, I feel sleepy, cold, tired, exhausted,  irritated, and my eyes are tired (with pressure like feeling) .... but I can't go back to sleep, or take a nap(during the day), I won't fall asleep even when I am exhausted! Other days it's more or less okay.

**Can you please help me to figure out, if those fatigue and exhaustion effects are associated with zolpidem or promethazine? Is there even a possibility that melatonin could be the cause?** 

It won't happen every night, but at least once or twice per week (it's unpredictable). Usually, when I keep waking up several times in the morning, I know for sure I will be exhausted for the rest of the day (even If I slept for 9 hours in total on that night).

In the past, my psychiatrist gave me a prescription for quetiapine 12.5 -25mg for sleep support (PRN use). I took it twice and I didn't like it at all! It made me feel groggy, drowsy, and confused for the whole next day. Trazodone didn't help with sleep, and it gave me the next-day side effects. Mirtazapine knocked me out, but I slept for 12 hours straight and I gained a lot of weight on this medication (even while I was on the lowest/starting dosage).

I am trying to get off zolpidem or at least reduce the dosage to a half. I know it's not healthy at all, especially taking it every night. In the past, my sleep problems were even worse, so I am glad that nowadays I am able to get some sleep for most of the days, even with the help of zolpidem.

317,Up at 4am and can’t fall back asleep I take 100 mg of trazodone for sleep and 20 mg of lexapro for anxiety / medication. I’m also prescribed 10/20 mg of hydroxyzine as needed. The trazodone helps me fall asleep but I wake up *every* morning at 4 am and almost always can’t go back to sleep. What should I do?,Trazodone
318,"What should I do to get to sleep tonight when my dad gets up at 4 am? So I share a 400sqft space with my dad and he recently took a position that means him getting up at 4 am. Unfortunately, because of his alarm combined him running the tap, clanking dishes, etc, this means I'm awake at 4 too, even with 32db rated ear plugs. It's about an hour between him getting up and him leaving so I'm well awake by the time the noise stops. The other issue is I am very very anxious when it comes to sleep, and it doesn't take much to make me spiral. I was up at 4 this morning after having a semi-restless sleep that started at around 12 am, and that combined with a few weeks worth of similarly shitty sleep has sent me into a really bad spiral. I've been in bed the entire day panicking on the verge of tears because I'm so anxious about it. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that's anxiety for you. Anyways, I need to get to sleep tonight and stay asleep, and I'm wondering how I should do that. Usually with these spirals, after it starts it becomes near impossible for me to get to sleep because I'm the entire night panicking. The meds I have are unisom, ativan, and trazodone. I've only tried the unisom and the ativan, the unisom is good but it doesn't really cut through the anxiety and leaves me exhausted all day. The ativan doesn't seem to be that strong even at 2mg so I'm not sure about that. The trazodone seems promising but most of all I just want to have a night of good, normal sleep that leaves me rested in the morning, and I'm not sure trying out a new med is the best bet there. What should I do here? My inclination to try the ativan but I've been using it a lot recently and I would definitely have to up my dose, but I'm not sure what a good dose is. Also, I don't know how long it works because I also want something that will either still be keeping me asleep at 4 am or at least make so I can get back to sleep easier if I do wake up. Any thoughts?",Trazodone
319,"I asked my doc for a sleep aid and something to treat my bad anxiety and he gave me lexapro and doxepin. I haven’t had a good nights sleep in almost a year. I’m definitely depressed and my anxiety is pretty out of control, but who wouldn’t feel like that after a year of not sleeping. I’m also on a cpap which has not changed anything. I fall asleep but can’t stay asleep. This combination of medications seemed a little either dramatic or not what I was expecting to be prescribed. I asked about trazodone, busporine, and Xanax and my doctor basically said he’d never prescribe me any of those. I don’t take anything at the moment except using the cpap. Does this seem like a logical first step? Like I said, I’m definitely depressed but it seems like it’s from not sleeping. I asked if I could just take the doxepin and he said no, you have to take both. Does anyone have any thoughts? I really don’t want to start on both of these at once especially because I won’t know which is causing what side effect.",Trazodone

For 6 months I have averaged about 2-3 hours of sleep per night. The most I have got is 5 hours in one night or in a 24 hour period. I can never sleep more then an hour straight. I have always struggled with sleep, but these last 6 months has taken a turn for the worst. I suffer from muscle twitching and when I do sleep, I dream right away and awake within an hour. The first 3 months, I tried OTC meds and various methods commonly used with no help. I then sought help from a sleep doctor who put me on trazodone. I have been on that for 3 months, and it has not helped. I am now on Doxepin. Picking up the meds tomorrow.

As you can imagine, the sleep deprivation has caused tremendous harm. Cognitive decline, mental breakdowns, etc. 

Well I have a genetic mutation called C9orf72 which causes ALS and dementia. I have posted here before with reassurance I do not have SFI or FFi but I am still at odds. My mutation is very close with SFI as it causes neuro degeneration and although I am no expert, there may be a correlation. I have read some medical papers and very similar. 

My insomnia has gotten progressively worse and I also have muscle spasms/twitching. I am currently on day 3 of no sleep Aside from a 30 minute rest. I went to the hospital after having no sleep for a long period and was sent home after vitals were good and heart was good. Really a waste of time sadly.

Now if anybody has read this far, do you think there is any correlation between my mutation C9orf72 and SFI/FFI? Would love to hear from someone other then someone just telling me I don’t have for the sake that it is incredibly rare.",Trazodone

The only way I can tell I was asleep is I remember the dreams I had. I've tried a lot of different things including Melatonin, Benadryl, Ashwagandha, GABA, Gabapentin, and just yesterday went to my local hospital with no insurance to their urgent care center.

328,"What helped you get over extreme drowsiness day after taking trazodone? I’ve had insomnia since I was a kid and have always had ups and downs struggling with it. I recently got prescribed trazodone after Ambien had zero affect on me. I took Seroquel as a teen but I also had drowsiness the next day and my doc said trazodone is safer w/ less side effects so I’m trying this.

I’m taking 50mg and considered cutting down but I read a lot of people got no effect with the medicine when they did this. It did a great job knocking me out last night but I woke up SO LATE and didn’t hear any of my alarms. Then I ended up falling back asleep without realizing it and was a few minutes late for work.

I need to sleep but my mental health rn isn’t the best and while I’ve been working on it and improving the last few months, I just can’t seem to sleep. However, there’s no point in me getting sleep if my whole entire day will be wasted and it’s hard to focus.

What has anyone changed with their routine taking this medicine that helped?

I just started trazodone a bit over a week ago, and at first, followed the advice of taking it with food. I’d have a single piece of low sugar chocolate right after taking it. 

I’ve already figured out I don’t sleep well, or at all, if I eat 2-3 hours before bed.  I’ll wake up within a couple hours and won’t be able to fall asleep until I eat something, then wake up again and need more food again, or I just won’t go back to sleep at all.

The nights I tried it with food, this was the case. Went to bed, woke up at 2am and there was no chance of going back to sleep. I’ve tried a couple nights with no food and I’m out pretty quickly, though I seem to continue struggling with staying asleep (different from fully waking up like from eating).

I went through a horrible breakup in November and picked up a vaping habit for many months after that. In January, I also got a kitten that was waking me up in the middle of the night for months.

Since ~January, I haven’t been able to sleep for more than 5-6 hour without waking up, and I’ll be up anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours (or sometimes I can’t go back to sleep at all). 

I don’t have too much of an issue falling asleep, but the middle of the night wakings are severely fucking me up. I’m either exhausted all day, or I’m in bed for 10-12 hours even though I only need 7-8 hours of straight sleep to feel fully rested. 

I’m at my wits end. I’ve had to push back my graduation by 6 months already because I have such a hard time concentrating with my shitty sleep.

339,"My insomnia story and what helped In April 2021, I had a sudden onset of insomnia. I’d wake up every night after an hour or so of sleep with intense anxiety and wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep. I tried cannabis, CBD/CBN, melatonin, meditation, Trazodone, Ambien, Lunesta. Nothing worked well, and some had lingering side effects that made me feel like crap during the day. 

Little to no sleep went on for about two months, which led to extreme anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. My wife and dad brought me to the ER when it got to such a point I told them I was worried I might try to end it. After that I took a leave of absence from work, my family helped me find a pyschiatrist that is practicing ketamine treatments for depressed/suicidal patients. She also hooked me up with a IFS therapist. The ketamine and IFS therapy were pivotal in my recovery, but I won’t dive into that on this insomnia sub. If you have questions on that, feel free to ask though. 

My insomnia was still bad and so I was prescribed Quetiapine (aka Seroquel). That stuff knocked me out to finally let me sleep, but I felt like a zombie during the day. I really wanted to get off it, but couldn’t sleep without it. One day in late July / early August, a friend told me that they had gone through a similar situation and the thing that finally worked for them was Seriphos. I ran to a local health store and grabbed a bottle. It worked on the very first night and I felt great in the morning! I was in shock. 

Now, every night I take one Seriphos and some magnesium before bed, and I sleep great. Getting my sleep back allowed me to start healing after I was diagnosed with PTSD and major depressive disorder. I was very close to ending my life, and Seriphos helped bring me back from the edge. 

Some info from manufacturers site and other online articles:

“Seriphos is a natural supplement with the main ingredient Phosphatidylserine. Seriphos was developed to aid in lowering cortisol when cortisol levels are elevated due to acute and chronic stress. Phosphatidylserine’s greatest benefit is its ability to lower cortisol levels by optimizing the brain’s relationship with the adrenal glands. It has also been shown to enhance brain function and memory, decrease anxiety and depression, improve mood, and enhance metabolism. It is one of the only substances we know of that can resensitize cortisol receptors that have been desensitized from chronic stress. It is also an antioxidant.”",Trazodone
340,"Only one sleeping med works for me TLDR at bottom but please only reply if you read the novel (post) below as otherwise I'll probably get replies about sleep studies or lavender tea.   


And it's one I really don't like being on - Seroquel.

Insomnia started when I went on Nardi for severe depression (have been on pretty much every type of antidepressant going over the last couple of decades - the only ones that worked were fluoxetine the first time I was prescribed it but it stopped working and has never worked since and Ketamine infusions - magic for a while but these days no effect).

Nardil was amazing at first, antidepressant wise. Right now it's probably helping but nothing like in the early months. I've been on it about 18 months.

The insomnia with Nardil has been severe. When I started Nardil I was already on Seroquel and was getting maybe 5 hours sleep, which I could handle. However more recently (couple of months ago) I came off Seroquel because I had put on weight and blamed Seroquel rather than my own gluttony and because the same dose was now giving me 3 hours sleep a night.

Came off Seroquel and had total insomnia for a few days. I was determined not to take any sleep meds just because the insomnia coming off Seroquel was so terrible, it wasn't something I wanted to go through more than once with another med. I thought if I could just get through it then natural sleep couldn't be much worse than 3 hours a night.

I was wrong. Even a month after coming off Seroquel I was having many nights of zero sleep and the other nights would be one or two hours. There were days I would fall asleep in the afternoon though. I also gained MORE weight because i was awake all night and not eating after dinner is easy enough if you're going to sleep at midnight and sleeping 8 hours but not so easy when you're awake all night.

I've tried Benzos, Z-drugs (both zopiclone and just last night 10mg zolpidem), DPH, Melatonin and all kinds of OTC supplements. My doc won't prescribe Trazodone because he's concerned about serotonin toxicity (there are articles disputing that but he still won't prescribe). Mirtazapine never helped me for sleep anyway and again, there's a 'serious' interaction possibility. Some of these drugs would help me get to sleep but I'd wake up after a couple of hours max. 

Seroquel - now I seem to need significantly more than the 25mg I was taking previously. In spite of all the 'less is more' when it comes to sleep stuff, that isn't true in my case. 300mg knocks me unconscious for 12 hours. Right now I'm just trying to find the right dose and guess it's going to be somewhere around 100mg. I know lots of people take that much and more. Still, I'm worried about becoming tolerant to its effects.

I should say I exercise 6 days a week, practice good sleep hygiene and am not stressed out or anything (I'm starting to become stressed about the lack of sleep but if I take the right drug I can fall asleep, i just can't stay asleep so I have the sleep maintenance type insomnia).

I could come off Nardil. It certainly triggered this (I have a medical history which means I'm always going to have to get up several times a night no matter what - will spare you the details - but I could always go right back to sleep) but I have two concerns with that: (i) that the insomnia now has a life of its own and coming off Nardil won't help; (ii) that unmedicated the depression is completely unmanageable and the most realistic option in terms of a med that may help is Parnate, which has an even worse profile for insomnia than Nardil does. 

I feel sort of scared that I'm down to ONE drug that can help me sleep. I had hoped to cycle meds. I feel that something like Ambien may work but I'd have to take more than 10mg which is the max prescribed dose. Possibly above 10mg isn't helpful for sleep anyway, you just end up doing a bunch of crazy stuff. 

I guess my only choice is to stick with the Seroquel and take whatever dose works. I just wondered if anybody else had any suggestions at all. I have talked with my doc but he hasn't really been helpful with this. He actually suggested CBT with a pal of his (referral fees, yay!) but I kind of feel that, for insomnia caused by a medication (Nardil) that's a bit like giving somebody meth then trying to get them to sleep using cognitive behavioural therapy. Of course it won't work because the drug causing the insomnia is massively overpowered compared to the benefit of any kind of therapy. I'm not saying Nardil is meth but there do seem to be some meth users that get better natural sleep than I do.   


TLDR: On an antidepressant where naturally I either don't sleep or sleep 1-2 hours a night. Tried pretty much everything to sleep that isn't contraindicated with Nardil. Only Seroquel works but at much higher doses than the 'typical' 25mg. Feel panicked that if Seroquel stops working or I get tolerant then I'm completely screwed. Also worried about long term Seroquel side effects (in particular tardive dyskinesia and akathisia). I'm probably just fucked but would appreciate any advice that doesn't involve lavender tea or warm baths, etc.",Trazodone

343,"Having mixed results with Trazodone, wondering if I should just stop taking it I've been taking it for exactly for a total of 8 days (100mg). My insomnia is caused by anxiety. Every time I take Trazodone it makes me sleepy and I feel like going to bed but I either don't fall asleep or do nod off for a bit until the tiniest thing wakes me up (eg. I moved my arm while sleeping and touched my wifes hand, or just her coming to bed quietly wakes me up. Or what actually started this whole problem for me, urinating at night which seems to be relating to stress and not health issues like I thought)

I did get about 3 nights of sleep on it out of the total 8, they weren't the longest though, just about 3 hours and waking up, then sleeping again for 2-3 hours.

I understand that Trazodone is best taken when you know you'll sleep the full length. 

So at this point would it be better for me to stop taking it? Should I lower to 50mg first for a few nights or go cold turkey. The one night I took 3 it did put me to sleep as soon as I went to bed but that's quite a large dosage.

I'm also taking duloxetine (cymbalta) in the morning, Dr. prescribed it to help with anxiety. I do notice that when I fall asleep it's mostly because I'm either so sleep deprived or not feeling any anxiety that night. So by that regard I wonder if I could fall asleep on my own with similar results.

That said, it’s a bit complicated for me to know where the tiredness is coming from. I’m narcoleptic, so that causes daytime sleepiness. Plus, I get fatigue from depression sometimes. I really want to keep going because studies show that it increases slow wave sleep (which I don’t get because of the narcolepsy). Mirtazapine (sp?) is another that is said to do that - if anyone uses that.

345,"Sudden insomnia out of nowhere UPDATE: Lunesta was fantastic. I slept like a baby, and didn’t have any adverse side effects besides a little bit of grogginess in the morning. I did make the mistake of not waiting long enough after eating dinner to take it, and had to take a second pill since I woke up 3 hrs into the first one, but regardless it worked like a charm. I’ll be on it for a week before my gp starts me on Trazodone long term to manage my anxiety. Overall feeling very optimistic.

Hi all,

I’m getting very desperate and I don’t know what to do about my current predicament.

It came on suddenly Monday evening. I had just moved apartments so I figured it was me still adjusting to the new environment. But it’s gotten worse. The last two nights I’ve gotten about 3 hours of sleep each, I feel like garbage. I fall asleep well enough but wake up after 3 hours and can’t get back to sleep. I’m pretty sure it’s my anxiety because I can’t get my mind to stop racing. I just started taking Magnesium Glycinate today in hopes that it will help, and I’m going to try benadryl tonight as well so I can at least get some sleep. For reference, like I mentioned above, I suffer with GAD in addition to PTSD, but I’ve never had problems sleeping until now. Does anyone have any advice? How did you start sleeping normally again? I have an appointment with my neurologist on Monday, but I really need some help to manage at home right now.

EDIT: Completely forgot to mention that I ordered this Stay Asleep product from Sandland Sleep, so if anyone has any experience with it let me know.

EDIT 2: Got very VERY lucky, my GP is on call all weekend and just got prescribed Lunesta to try, and if that doesn’t work Ambien. Very excited!",Trazodone
346,"People who have managed insomnia for a long time. How do you do it? A little over 2 weeks ago I started having chest pain. Instead of immediately going to the doctor I lay there in bed for 2 nights, wide awake, worried that it might be heart failure.

 Finally I went to Urgent Care and they thought it was a stomach ulcer. I got some meds to keep my acid levels down and they worked, my chest pain is no longer an issue. 

Sleep never really returned after that though. Those 2 nights I think I trained my brain to associate lying in bed with anxiety, so now whenever I go to bed my heart starts racing and I cant sleep. 

I was prescribed trazodone recently and that knocked me out for a couple nights of poor quality sleep. I only knew that I had slept by looking at the clock. Last night was another sleepless night and I fear that my body rapidly adapted to the meds. 

I have hurt myself by looking up certian prion diseases that I'm sure all of you are tired of hearing about. I know that my chances are so low, especially at my age (I'm 20) but my stupid anxiety riddled brain can't help but think ""what if?"" 

My sleep hygiene was awful before all this, but I did sleep and feel rested almost every night. I may seem sheltered but before it happened to me I had no real idea that this could HAPPEN to a person for such silly reasons. 

I don't want to rely on meds. I want to have good sleep hygiene. I'm trying to go to bed at a consistent time, but it's hard to train your brain when you never actually sleep when you lie down. The heart palpitations start pretty soon after I get in bed, and I have to get up and do something else because continuing to train my brain to associate bed with anxiety is no good. 

I fear my insomnia will become chronic. I know me continuing to worry about sleep will guarentee that happens, like some sick self fulfilling prophecy. My biggest struggle is just... letting go. I don't know how to do that. My brain has always raced at a million miles, before all this I used to make up stories in my head to make me fall asleep. Now all my thoughts have turned to anxiety. 

TL:DR I fucked myself up and now I'm trying to unfuck myself, but I dont really know where to begin. I need to learn to let go of anxiety.",Trazodone

I've had insomnia since I can remember. My earliest memory of it was when I was around 3 or 4. My dad worked the late shift and would get home a little after midnight, I was always still up.

School sucked because I wasn't getting any sleep. I finally dropped out when I was 15.

My adult life I was always told, just lay down and sleep, try some melatonin, benadryl works, none of that works for me.

&#x200B;

In my late 30s I finally went to the dr and was prescribed Ambien. It worked great for about a year, but then it would put me to sleep but I would be up in about an hour. They tried ambien to put me to sleep and trazodone to keep me asleep. Again that worked for a while but then that even stopped. They tried me on several other pills and nothing worked so I just stopped trying.

&#x200B;

I decided to not stress about not sleeping. For a few years I did okay and would sleep 3-5 hours every night or day. Recently I've been having trouble sleeping again. I don't really feel tired but I know I need to sleep at some point. The longest I've ever gone with zero sleep was 5 nights and by then I was hallucinating. I had to take a couple xanax to finally fall asleep and then only slept a couple hours.

Ive been on ambien on and off for the past 3 months or. I was off for a month and a half. I have struggled with bad insomnia ever since being on (and since getting off) psychiatric drugs. Ambien and as needed ativan are my only remaining drugs. It works very well for me, but i have memory loss and am worried about dependence. I was looking at Lunesta, but in terms of dependence and memory issues it doesnt seem much better. I dont have any abuse issues with the ambien, i only take it for its intended use. Any alternatives? 

Ive tried: trazodone, melatonin, various psych drugs, ashwanganda, vistaril, benadryl. I cannot take ssris or any drug that affects serotonin reuptake. Side effects im hoping to avoid are (most important) weight gain, and major sexual dysfunction",Trazodone

Why is Xanax the only one that works? I tried Belsomra for the first time last night. Took it at 830, and I was already very tired from lousy sleep the night before. By 930, I was so sleepy, but not from the Belsomra. Just from being tired. I finally dozed and dreamt briefly to wake up at 11pm. It didn't feel like a restful sleep. Might as well have been vividly daydreaming. I finally gave up and took Xanax (I know, don't mix your sleep meds with benzos). After that.... Right to sleep. Restful sleep.

No hangover from the belsomra, which I had worried about. 

I didn't feel particularly anxious going to sleep last night. A little nervous maybe, given how horrible Lunesta was for me.

But I took the Xanax. And slept.

It's a constant fight with my doctors. But goddamnit, it works. I have an early rising 2 year old, and my husband is a deploying military man. I HAVE to sleep at night. I have to be awake and alert for my baby.

I’ve tried higher doses of trazodone, seroquel, vistaril, benadryl, even ambien for a month once which actually helped but my doc didn’t want to prescribe any more as it can be habit-forming. I also take adderall during the day which certainly doesn’t help my insomnia, but I can barely function without it due to pretty severe ADHD. I’m stuck.

358,"Years of Extreme Sleep Deprivation & University (HELP) Has anyone here had issues with chronic insomnia and sleep deprivation after taking a sleeping med long-term? 

For several years now I’ve had chronic insomnia. My insomnia started when I was around 13 when I was also diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depression. At age 14 my psychiatrist prescribed me Trazodone and I took that medication daily until I was around 18. 

To my dismay, it seemed I couldn’t get any sleep without my trazodone. I couldn’t get a referral to see a sleep specialist because I lived in a medical healthcare desert with few specialist. My psychiatrist just put me back on Trazodone which I believe is what’s perpetuating my chronic insomnia. 

I’m 20 now and I just transferred to a prestigious university. I wanted to get off Trazodone for good before coming here so allowed my prescription to run out two months ago. I thought I could come off Trazodone and readjust to sleeping without medication.

I can’t. I haven’t been able to get more than 3 hours of sleep and that’s only if I’m on a 24 hour sleep deficit. Luckily, my research university has plenty of specialist and resources available so I’m desperately trying to schedule an emergency appointment with a sleep specialist but it’s a process. Midterms are coming up and my memory is severely impaired. I’m afraid I’ll flunk my exams because of my memory issues related to sleep..

359,"Does anyone use clonidine intermittently/as needed, as opposed to every night? After failing with several other meds (melatonin, antihistimines, trazodone), my doctor has prescribed clonidine for my insomnia. My understanding is that most people take clonidine every night, since there can be rebound blood pressure spikes if you abruptly stop taking it. However, I'm hesitant to start taking this medicine every day, for the following reasons:

1) I occasionally have a glass of wine or two with dinner and I'm worried about the potential interaction with clonidine. I'm not sure how serious it actually is, but plenty of sites say things like, ""avoid, very serious interactions can occur,"" so it's enough to make me nervous.

2) I'm quite an active runner, and I'm hesitant to regularly take any medication that will seriously affect my blood pressure or athletic performance. 

So my question is - does anyone here just use clonidine on an as-needed basis, e.g. once per week on a night when you really need to sleep before a big day at work? Or is this a terrible idea due to the rebound blood pressure effects?

I’m destroying my mornings and health by continuing to take trazodone.

I’m a big guy (6’3, 220) and athletic so I already eat a lot and trazodone makes me binge on anything available at night. It’s out of control! Leftovers, fruit, and the normal stuff, but also dry pasta, dry rice! It’s not even logical. It’s insanity. I find myself making meals, ordering meals. Foods I don’t even eat. Fast food I find gross (Taco Bell). Woke up at 11 after going to bed at a responsible time and freaking ordered a pizza last night. I don’t even eat pizza very often and don’t seek it out.

I track my calories and I know I’m not in a deficit so this isn’t my body seeking out food in starvation mode. 

Trazodone seems to make me sleep eat, binge while I’m still awake, and put me into a dream state the following morning. The only way I’ve been able to escape the hangover is through cardio (run, stairmaster, fast paced lifting), otherwise I’m slightly foggy brained until lunch.

362,"Can't find a doctor to help me Long story, sorry.

I've had insomnia since puberty, when all my puberty related mental health problems started. Worsened over the years by various traumas.

I've seen many primaries, even a psychiatrist who had me on four medications to sleep at night. I've tried nearly everything.

I used to suffer from both onset and maintenance insomnia. Now it's just onset. Ambien was ineffective. Lunesta had me awake every 15 minutes throughout the night. I can't have tricyclics because of previous suicidal ideation on those meds. Benadryl gives me restless legs and fuzzy wakings all throughout the night. Melatonin gives me a major sleep hangover. I have a 2 year old, and my husband leaves frequently on deployments so I'm the caretaker. Trazodone is inconsistent, either it doesn't work, or it gives me a sleep hangover, depending on how much I eat. 

Sleep study shows no apnea. My sleep doctor and I are convinced this is anxiety related insomnia. I can't shut my brain off. 

I was given Xanax for my anxiety, but found it helped me sleep so much that I've been using it for sleep for years. But every time I get a PCP that understands I'm not a Xanax abuser, and willingly prescribes it for sleep, they leave the practice, or I PCS to a new state. 

With Xanax, there's no hangover. Just restful, sleepy, quiet minded rest. 

My new PCP thinks I'm a drug seeker. She's malevolently making it hard for me to get Xanax (or suggest any medication I haven't tried). She's told me to take melatonin 5 times in two visits. When requesting a Xanax refill, she dodged my calls for a week before finally filling it, after she told me over the phone she'd fill it for me. That's a week of getting shit sleep with melatonin and Benadryl so I wouldn't lie in bed awake for 5 hours, or using alcohol to sleep (not healthy, plus the migraines). 

I'm looking for a new primary, because this one clearly hates me. Even her reviews state she's told other patients to just go to church for their problems.

I'm trying to find a new psychiatrist. But the wait lists are either months out, or they won't return my calls.

I'm at my wits end. Currently trying to get a prior auth for Belsomra, but Tricare is shit with authorizing non-formulary meds. 

I don't care about talking Xanax. I just want to sleep. If getting off the Xanax will make doctors stop treating me like a drug addict, I'll do it.

363,"Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety and tons of drugs Hello, I have a close friend in another country who needs some help that he’s not getting at home.  His medical problems started about seven years ago with insomnia which snowballed into myriad other afflictions, many of them side-effects of the medications: depression, anxiety, muscle pain/weakness, persistent nausea/vomiting, total lack of appetite, ED and suicidal ideation.  He and his doctors have tried an astonishing array of drugs (detailed below) but have made no progress in treating his insomnia and the other problems reduce his quality of life to near-zero.  To complicate things further, an unfortunate family situation routinely serves to make things worse.

I’m posting here today because we’re hoping to find: 

\- medical professionals who don’t believe that the answer is “more drugs”

\- other individuals struggling, recovering or recovered from similar circumstances

\- recommended courses of action

\- facilities or support organizations with relevant expertise 

&#x200B;

As his friend, I believe that his doctors at home (in a country with public healthcare) have neither the resources nor the incentives to make him better, and so their efforts to medicate him are more about stabilization than recovery.  In other words, I believe that his doctors have basically given up.  I will not.  We eagerly welcome anything positive that this community has to offer.  Thank you.

364,"Prescribed Valproate ER for insomnia with no history of bipolar disorder and on ADHD medicine? I have a history of primarily anxiety based insomnia, although obviously I couldn't take Adderall free of any other medications an hour before bed and fall asleep, it's otherwise not directly linked to my insomnia in my years of experience of taking it. I can skip it on an anxiety ridden day and still stay up the entire night mind racing, I can have an exciting fulfilling day with no major anxiety stressors and still fall asleep  before midnight having had 500mg of caffeine throughout the day along with my typical dosage of Adderall.

Trazodone and Amitriptyline were a disaster and a larger disaster each, as I literally could wake up after sleeping 12 hours, take an adderall to hopefully wake up, and sleep another 4 hours afterwards the Amitriptyline was so inhibiting that after taking it the night before the result of forgetting to take my Adderall  before work to help counteract it was literally falling asleep on my feet and then getting a DUI on my lunch break. That's not a problem I've ever had caused by simply skipping the adderall.

Ambien worked, if I was already half way relaxed and fell asleep in that 1 hour window, otherwise by the time I'd feel the anxiety slipping away, I'd start feeling the sedation lift as well. So now I finally gave into the relentless urging to try some kind of anti psychotic or bipolar medication such as seroquel and accepted Valproate as an option. Now I see she prescribed the more expensive, and much more likely to render my unfunctional the next day extended release version.

From my point of view it sounds like the exact opposite kind of medication someone who needs Adderall to concentrate should be on and a poor solution for anxiety at it's worst when I lack energy and feel depressed thus unable to handle the things that keep me up at night.

Is there a chance that these issues and drugs won't clash and that it'll work fantastic for sleep yet not impair me during the day? Or is this like it seems to me probably a very bad combination.",Trazodone

Ive tried prescriptions such as hydroxyzine and trazodone but these give me the same results.

I have tried thc, cbd, and cbn and these did not improve my sleep range.

371,"Averaging 2-3 hours a night for 5 months and broken mentally. Not sure why I keep posting on here like it will help, but I’m just broken mentally right now. I’ve been averaging about 2-3 hours of sleep these last 5 months now. Everyday I drag myself out of bed and somehow get through work. Constant headache, body ache, fatigue, depression, anxiety, you name it. I’m wasting away my life. No energy to do anything. I’m irritable and take it out on my family. Bad thoughts all the time 

I messaged my sleep doctor yesterday stating my issues have not gotten better and I’m going through a hard time and all she does is say to up my trazodone prescription which already does nothing. 

My sleep doctor will only prescribe trazodone and I am waiting to see a psychiatrist in about a month to go through a whole work up.I could go to the walk in, but that’s just another expense and most likely they won’t do anything instead check my vitals like last time I went and tell my to keep following my sleep doctor advice. 

I was so exhausted when I came home from work today that I passed out as soon as I walked in the door. Of course, 2 hours later I’m wide awake. Been in bed ever since. 

I constantly see people here tell there stories, and everyone at least seems to be able to get good sleep once and awhile, but not me. Sometimes I’ll get lucky with 6 once a month and even that’s broken. I haven’t slept more then 6 hours in 5 months. Can only sleep 2 hours at a time. 

Of course I’m at the point I need meds which I’m in the process of trying but it’s been a long process. I feel like I’m doomed for 2-3 hours the rest of my life. My sleep journal is a joke. I’ve averaged 3 hours a day for 5 months Don’t  know if I can go on like that. Anyway, I will probably stop posting as nobody cares to read this.",Trazodone

It also does not help due to the fact I went to the doctors and they have not been doing much of anything to help and I really hope this doctor helps the doctors I have been going to I've been trying to keep me on the medication that they have me on but I had a really bad side effects and also they said I might have also gone Mania from it.

Since I have counted that I have 3 hours til my alarm goes off, I’m likely screwed in the sleep dept for tonight. But this isn’t meant to be a negative post or anything like that.

Hey everyone, so i’ve probably tried posting something similar to this a few weeks back, but i’m desperate so i’m trying again. 

Ive been prescribed/using adderall for about 3-4 years. Last year i decided to take a few months off because it was causing insomnia & while taking adderall the next day would completely cancel out that sleepiness & make seem as though i slept fine, it was still a bummer & annoying. After those months off, i realized life was much better on adderall & it helped me in a lot of ways that i couldn’t deny, so i reached out to my doctor & asked if he could prescribe me something to help with the insomnia caused by adderall. 


In retrospect, i feel like it was the worst mistake i could’ve made. At first i didn’t realize it because my doc prescribed me a very low dose of trazodone. Then he upped the dose from 50 mg to 100 mg. It didn’t become that apparent to me that the trazodone was diminishing the effects of the adderall & causing me daytime drowsiness/lack of focus till about 5 months later. i decided with my doctor to start tapering off the trazodone. It’s been almost 2 months now since i’ve completely stopped & im still dealing with those effects. I know it’s not a tolerance issue because everything was fine prior to introducing the sleep meds into my regimen. I also take a bunch of additional supplements for cellular function & tolerance like L-tyrosine, Magtein, acetyl l-carnitime & a few herbs/nootropics for better cognitive & anti stress function. Could anyone chime in with their own experiences or guess what the issue is? I feel like my brain chemistry is fucked & i’m hoping things return to normal eventually",Trazodone

393,"Is anyone having severe insomnia after being hospitalized for bipolar disorder? So this is a long story but I’m going to try to keep it short. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this because this also involves some mental problem, but I’m posting here since our current concern is about his sleeping problem. 

Back in March my husband had a manic episode of bipolar disorder (euphoria) and had to be taken to the hospital. This is the second time this has happened to him (first time was like 10 years ago). He stayed in the psych ward for about 2 weeks. In the discharge papers I read that he had schizophrenia. He told me “they said I am bipolar.” After he was released nothing has been the same again. In the beginning after he was released, he couldn’t sleep all night. After a few days he went to stay with his parents in his home state (where he was also hospitalized) and said he was sleeping fine (not as well as before I guess). Then he went back and forth his parents house and our house (in a different state) a few times. 

From mid April to mid May he slept okay. Then late May it started to worsen. This is when he stopped taking the meds he was prescribed (risperidone and divalproex) because he believed they were causing his insomnia. Slowly his sleep was getting less and less and now he can’t sleep at night at all, and stays in bed all day and gets a little bit of sleep, like he falls asleep for a few mins and wakes up and again it takes a while to fall asleep. We have no idea why he is like this and where to get help. 

He went to the ER two times, once in my state and once in his home state, both times he was told to get more physically active and no other solution. Over his phone appointment with his outpatient psychiatrist, he told the doctor about this so he prescribed him trazodone. My husband took it for a few days thinking it was sleep aid or something until one day he read the papers that came with it and found out it was actually antidepressant, so he stopped taking it. 

He’s been at his parents’ house now and I live with family near our old place. He wanted to stay with his own family so that if something happened to him then they could take care of him. I talk to him once a day and don’t see him in person so I don’t have any other details or observations besides what he tells me since we aren’t living together. This is affecting him even more and I think he’s slowly becoming depressed. Before he would talk and smile when I called but now he only responds when I ask him things or else it’s just silence, he barely says things from his own. He’s worried over why he can’t sleep. 

Does anyone or anyone you know ever been through insomnia like this after a manic episode or something similar to what happened to my husband? If so how did you deal with it? At this point we are getting nowhere with him getting better.",Trazodone

395,"My Experience with Trazodone and Where to go From Here Hello all, 

Long time insomniac. To give you a short run-down, I've had trouble sleeping all my life. Natural night-owl, find it impossible to go to sleep early unless I absolutely wreck my sleep schedule and suffer for a day or 2. Have been taking adderall and Vyvanse for ADHD that went untreated for years. Been on these for the last 3 years, which have honestly made my insomnia worse, but they are a necessity for me in medical school now. 

I started taking trazodone about 6 weeks ago. Real fast I realized that this drug was PERFECT for me. Not too sedating, but just enough to get me to sleep. For the first time in a decade, I slept through the night without issues. I was waking up with more energy, my adderall and vyvanse felt like they were twice as effective, and my anxiety was at an all-time low. It felt like my life was taking a 180 because of trazodone. 

After two weeks, things started getting a little different. The orthostatic hypotension wasn't too bad, but it started getting borderline dangerous at times. This kinda went away. But that new focus I had found slowly started to dissipate. I went from feeling amazing to feeling groggy all day long. It felt like my adderall and vyvanse weren't working anymore. I went from being super energized every morning to taking 2-3 hours just to reach what I would call a sub-optimal level of functionality. I started throwing some caffeine in every now and then, but now even that is ineffective. The weirdest part - auditory hallucinations. Now I've consistently been getting 8 hours of sleep. So I know I'm not in some sort of stimulant-induced psychosis. Over the last 4 weeks, it has happened maybe 2-3 times. Just hearing noises that I knew weren't there. 

This last week, things have gotten bad. Total brain fog all day long. This weird, vague headache when I've never had headaches my entire life. It feels like my libido is totally gone. Intense feelings of depersonalization/derealization. At times I feel depressed. Most of the time I just feel numb. Barely feels like my adderall or vyvanse are working at all. I recently upped my dose too after being on the same dose for 2 years in preparation for a big exam. I've been taking all sorts of  vitamins for brain health. With the addition of good sleep, I doubt I'm hitting some sort of stimulant tolerance. What has really scared me though are the auditory hallucinations. They used to only occur at night, but for the past two days, they've occurred during the day. Hearing someone knocking on the front door, only to see no one there. Hearing the refrigerator water dispenser activating, going out of my room to talk to my roommate and realizing no one is home. And this morning this feeling of a lump in my throat that is borderline painful.

 I am still grounded in reality, but I am worried. My big exam is in a week and I've wondered if I should just quit the trazodone cold turkey. I noticed my symptoms were worse on an increased dose, so I'm almost certain its the trazodone. I plan on asking my doc for a 7 day course of ambien just to hold me over until my test, as he has done that in the past and its been effective. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I am really worried.

405,"Trazodone taking too long to kick in I'm prescribed 50mg of trazadone and have been taking it for a while. I don't take it daily and usually only need to use it 2-3 times a week at most. When I do need to use it, I really do need it. My problem is that lately it's been taking a while to kick in after taking a dose. Rarely will it begins to work 30min after taking it. Usually it will begin to work around 2-3 hours after taking a dose.

Why is this happening? I've tried drinking more acidic liquids to help my body devolve it faster, but that doesn't seem to help. It's becoming a problem since I usually take it once I get home from work so I can go to bed right away. The longer it takes to kick in, the more sleep I lose.

Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there any sort of liquid version I'd be able to take that may kick in faster?",Trazodone
406,"Does anyone use a sleeping pill daily? Hi all, 

Just curious, I see many of you write that you are on Ambiens, Lunestas, Trazodones, etc. What exactly do you mean by that, do you take your medication for two weeks, then quit, do you take it here and there, as needed, or do you take it every night in order to sleep, and is your doctor OK with that?

The reason I'm asking is this: I am a chronic lifelong insomniac. Every night is tough, every day is filled with exhaustion and brain fog. I am unable to get to a psyhciatrist for various reasons, so I self-medicate, sort of (Valium and other things).
I do this every night. Of course, the efficacy is lesser and lesser. 
So I was just wondering, anyone of you on daily therapy? But real, not self-imposed like mine 

Are there pills one can take every night?

If I one day finally get to a shrink, and they prescribe something for two-three weeks, that will be a welcome relief, but in my case only temporary. I don't need pills to '""get my sleep back on track"", as they are usually prescribed, my sleep has always been out of whack and no short-term prescription is going to fix that.

So is there hope of a combination of pills one day that I could rely on every day, when I finally see a shrink? Of course, with tweaks and changes as time goes by. Or am I doomed to be exhausted like this till the end.

Thank you.",Trazodone

409,"Wake up around 2-3am every night, and can’t sleep deeply afterwards. I’ve been dealing with insomnia for about 4 months with a 1 month period of good sleep in between.

I’m a 23 year old male with a life time of anxiety, but never had sleep issues until now. It all started when I got a UTI that was interfering with my sleep bc of constantly having the urge to pee. 

I’m a hypochondriac with a history of making things seem worse than they actually are, so even once the UTI was gone I still thought I had the urge to pee that was keeping me up. But at this point I don’t believe it was full blown insomnia, because I was still able to get deep sleep, I just had issues getting to sleep for about an hour.

But after awhile, I noticed my sleep was getting lighter, especially towards the morning hours. And I could tell that overall I wasn’t getting good quality of sleep. I then started to get severe anxiety about this, and this is when my true insomnia started. For about a week in the very begging of my insomnia journey I was only getting 2-3 hours of sleep a night. I started taking melatonin that helped briefly, and started to get me to about 5 hours of sleep. After about two weeks when my insomnia first started, I started to get better and had perfect sleep for about a month. I changed nothing, but naturally got better.

Fast forward to about a month later, I was going through a somewhat stressful time where I moved out of my parents house for the first time and into an apartment with my girl friend. The first week or so of sleep in the new apartment was fine, and then I had one night of crappy sleep, where it was really light towards the latter half of the night. This kicked on my anxiety again, and it’s been chronic insomnia since then. About 3 months total. 

I’ve been prescribed Trazodone, which helps because I’m able to fall asleep, but my main issue is waking up around 3am ever night, and tossing and turning for the rest of the night through very light sleep. My insomnia is the only source of anxiety with my life right now. Could it be the stress of insomnia itself that is waking me up at 3am every night? I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on.",Trazodone
410,"How I've beaten insomnia Hi all, here is a positive post for a change :)

My story with insomnia started in April 2020, a little after the pandemic hit us. It started with 10 days of no sleep. Yes, you read it correctly: 10 days. For 10 days I'd lay in bed, close my eyes for 8 hours, but I was fully awake. After the 4th day of no sleep, I  sought help. My family doctor tried several medications without success. From trazodone to zopiclone, she tried everything but I simply could not sleep. On the 11th day, I got like 2 hours of sleep, but I believe it was mainly because I was too damn tired. After lots of trials, I kind of adapted to a very high dose of Trazodone, which allowed me to sleep around 4 hours every other day. I was also doing  Behavioral Therapy, following EVERY SINGLE F\*\*\*ING RULE to the tee.  I considered that a relief after the 10-days-of-no-sleep experience. But of course, I was not fully happy.I had minor depression and lots of anxiety. Lost and gained weight. Stopped working. And I simply was not myself. That life lasted until February 2021. In February 2021 I had another no-sleep streak of 5 days, which made me want to do something different about my insomnia. The 4 hours of sleep every other day was just not how I wanted to live life, and my body was screaming ""DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT IT"". Trazodone and Behavioral Therapy was not the answer to my problem. I've sought another therapist, which used the EFT approach (Emotion Focused Therapy). She made it very clear that insomnia was not the problem, insomnia was a symptom of my problem: which was/is anxiety (and most likely it's yours too, dear reader). There's no point in trying to treat the insomnia itself... as long as I'm an anxious person, insomnia would always be in my life as a symptom of that. Funny thing is that the insomnia itself became something that caused me anxiety. I'd think EVERY SINGLE NIGHT: ""Will I sleep tonight? Will I not? What will happen tomorrow if I don't sleep? I have an important meeting tomorrow, I need to sleep!"", and that itself was a stressor. So I've started treating my anxiety and life got better pretty quickly, actually. I took control over my sleep, started sleeping better and better every night. Insomnia eventually became a once-in-a-month thing, most nights I'd sleep 8 hours. After understanding that anxiety should be my concern (not insomnia), even my night routine changed. To avoid thinking of problems, things I need to do the day after, thinking ""will I sleep tonight or not?"", etc (common thoughts that cross an anxious person's mind at night), I started reading in bed every night. I now read fiction books every night until my eyes get heavy, then I simply put the book aside and quickly fall asleep. That keeps my mind away from problems, and also makes my eyes tired (which helps a lot). Controlling my anxiety was key, not only to treat my insomnia, but also in so many other aspects of life! :)A week ago I stopped having melatonin at night, another victory in my journey to recovery. Now I sleep with absolutely no help from any medication.

If you need to take something from my experience is that: INSOMNIA IS A SYMPTOM OF ANOTHER PROBLEM. Treat that other problem. Also: man, reading in bed really helps a lot. Try that if you haven't already!

Wish you good luck in your journey, and hope you'll get better too. You will! This will not last forever... believe me 😘",Trazodone

I worked my ass off to be able.to have a bit of extra money to pay out of pocket for a doctor's visit. My doctor prescribed me trazodone which I was ecstatic about. I thought to myself, ""Finally! I did it. I'll finally be able to sleep"". 

I took my first 50 mg at 8:30 pm and took a shower. I figured by the time I got out of the shower it would be starting to kick in. Shower ends. Nothing. I decide to lay down and an hour goes by. Nothing. Two hours. Nothing. At this point I decide to take another half as I'm starting to panic because I was really expecting to be asleep. I took my half and the night goes on with no results. I got a whopping hour and a half of sleep. Same ol shit.

416,"From One Insomnia to Another Hello. A few months ago, I posted about having very severe Onset Insomnia issues, where I simply could not fall asleep without having panic attacks, and it had gotten to the point that, in my waking moments, all I could think about is if I could sleep.  


Well. Things certainly have changed since those seven months ago, but now it honestly feels like my insomnia has flipped itself around. Now, I usually have little issue getting to sleep, though it does take about an hour for me to relax enough. However, as of last night due to perked curiosity over why I've been feeling perpetually exhausted, I realized I don't sleep solidly anymore. Last night, I recorded waking up about four time; going to bed at 10, roughly sleeping around 11, and waking every 3 or so hours after that. The last, fourth one, was only an hour, because it had already turned 9:30 AM at that time.  


So, I roughly woke at 2 AM, 5 AM, 8 AM, and then finally 9:30 AM, after a minor doze.  


I do have sleep aids that I think I'm going to try and see if they help improve. One is Trazodone, prescribed more specifically for sleep issues. But the other, which was more prescribed for when I have anxiety/panic attacks, I may try tonight; Hydroxyzine. I remember taking it once about a month ago, and I felt like I slept the most soundly on it.  


I'm hoping the sleep aids work (I'm obviously not taking both at same time, more like I'll take one tonight, maybe the other tomorrow should I find myself stirring awake again.) I did read stuff about Sleep Apnea can cause issues like this, though I have no real way of knowing if I have it; I live alone, so not like people can tell me I'm snoring or gasping in my sleep. But what physical symptoms I've read about, like morning headaches, I haven't experienced.  


I guess this is more a ramble than anything, but it just feels perplexing to me that, in a course of about half a year, it feels my insomnia has completely flip-flopped. From being unable to fall asleep, to now being unable to stay asleep.

419,"Beat insomnia Hello everybody, I finally was able to beat severe insomnia after half a year. I was diagnosed with insomnia January 4th, after being sleepless for 3 days. I had a black out during New Years, and after that I could not sleep. I would sleep for a few hours every 3 days, making me so exhausted and affecting my everyday life. End of January I got prescribed trazodone 50mg, told to take it every night. I did, and sometimes I would try to sleep without it here and there but it was impossible. I felt so disappointed in myself. I never had trouble sleeping, before so for me it was devastating after everything that happened this past years(personal stuff). After a while I took care of these personal stuff, and made peace with myself. And by making peace I mean spending time alone, doing stuff I used to enjoy. Then I stopped using my social media as much, due to all the negativity. And then when I felt that I had enough peace inside me I decided one night to throw my prescription away and regain what I lost. And it’s been a month since I been sleeping without medication. I sleep for 7 hours uninterrupted, don’t wake up during the night as I used to even with medication. And that’s my story, I wanted to share it with everybody in this community.
For everybody that deals with it, you can beat it. It’s in your head, and the only way to fix it is to identify the problem. Find what troubles you and work on it, if you fail try again. I hope the best to everybody",Trazodone
420,"Insomnia for the past 12 years. Been on every medicine available. Finally found a fix. Bring all of your skepticism, I understand, but its real and has turned my life around. 30yo male here. Had pretty bad insomnia since I was 18. 

Here's a TLDR; for those that don't want to read the wall of text below: 
10 years of life disrupting insomnia, 2 years of life ending insomnia. Have taken nearly all available prescriptions to try to sleep. Few worked, all came with side effects eventually that worsened my health. While trying to repair the damage that chronic multi-day long sleeplessness created, I stumbled upon a cheap and readily available cure for all of my issues including my insomnia. A peptide called GHRP6. I would put it under my tongue at night, eat a huge meal, and then become intensely tired. First time in my adult life I slept like a fucking rock. It has been 4 months and it has been only consistent success. Totally safe to take for as long as you want. And comes with the added benefit of increase healing, anti-aging, etc.

---------

I have two main causes of my insomnia, basically. First is, I have racing thoughts. Will replay the day, the past week, year, decade, etc in my head. Can't clear my mind and fall asleep. Second, I have a crazy adrenaline response. If I hear a noise, my adrenaline spikes and my heart pounds. If I am having trouble falling asleep, then I get nervous that I am going to have a shitty day the next day, so then my heart start racing and then I don't sleep because of it... etc. 

at 22yo I took trazodone and it definitely made me sleep if I stayed with an ever increasing dose. It gave me brain fog, short term memory issues, a few other side effects which were serious enough to where I had to get off of it. 

I started taking vyvanse for work after I graduated college, and it did not worsen my insomnia from what it was until about age 26. 

At age 26, I would go atleast 1 night a week without sleeping at all, and then a few days with 4-5 hours of sleep. The vyvanse made it to where it wasn't really an issue to deal with though.

At 27 I got on Ambien, then lunesta, hydroxizine, a few other benzos, amitriptyline, and a few others. Lunesta was the only one that did anything, and I slept well for a while. It eventually stopped working, and about 16 months ago, I went into a serious dark bottomless pit of insomnia.

At 29, roughly 16mo ago, I went through a period of time, while on lunesta, where I wouldnt sleep for up to 5 days. Not your typically, rolling around, falling in and out of a shallow sleep and then telling people you didnt sleep at all ... I mean stare at the fucking ceiling for 5 hours and then get up and go to work, for 5 days in a row. This lasted for about 4 months until my body and brain gave out on me. I developed an anxiety disorder. I had lost like 20lbs. I had circulation issues. Stomach ulcers. gastritis. IBS. I couldn't focus at all. I couldn't work. 

I focus first on the anxiety issues, which lead to SSRIs and SNRIs which made everything 1000 times worse. My sleeping became worse. etc.  

So then I switched to trying to treat the gastro issues. After diagnosing stomach ulcers and gastritis and IBS, they put me on PPIs and a few other things, none of which helped. Only made it worse. So I did a bit of my own research and came across a few medical studies on peptides, which led me to BPC 157 which is a peptide for healing. This helped briefly, but wierdly enough, it made me sleep very well for about a week then it went away.

So after that semi successful run of a peptide I bought off the internet. I looked into others. I read another medical journal about GHRP 6, which is a mimic of a peptide your body creates that tells your body when its hungry and ready to eat. It also helps release your own human growth hormone. I started taking that in order to help stimulate my appetite and bring blood flow to my GI tract and initiate healing. And it worked like a fucking charm. I was eating more than I had in forever, and my stomach issues were rapidly improving. But the one thing that increased more than anything else..... MY SLEEP. 

Before I started these peptides, I got off sleep medicine, because any pill was hurting my gastritis. I obviously struggled with that and dealt with worsening insomnia, but I pushed through it. 

I upgraded the course of GHRP6 that I was taking to include another peptide that further increases your own human growth hormone production, called CJC1295 (no dac), and have been taking those two 1-2 times a day for the past 3-4 months. I am back on my vyvanse, I also drink caffeine again (which I quit for 7 years due to insomnia), and I am sleeping better than I have in my whole life. I actually get tired at night, I lay down, and I am out. I may wake up to piss or eat a snack, but back to bed until proper rise-n-shine time.  

I have been working out for the past 4 months, which is something I havent done consistently in 7 years due to no having the energy and not being able to drink caffeine. I have gain ~30lbs back that I lost from my rock-bottom era 16 months ago. 

The best part is, this peptide is something that you can take for as long as you want. It does not downregulate your own ghrelin or GH production and you do not develop a tolerance for it. And the cherry on top is, your growth hormone blood levels are increase to 3-4x their normal levels, so your skin is younger, hair is longer and thicker, nails are more healthy, your body heals faster, and your muscles in theory repair faster. It basically makes you feel younger.

Would also like to give a shout out to Clonidine and Guanfacine. Those are 2 medicines that are called alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. They are technically blood pressure medicines, but they are also prescribed for ADHD. They also happen to boost your own natural human growth hormone. I started taking them a few months back, and they tone down my adrenaline response. At the beginning of this post, I mentioned that my adrenaline response was too strong and it kept me up at night with a beating heart. This eliminates that and calms my mind. Really helps with the whole insomnia thing.

In early May I had a crazy spell of insomnia that led to multiple days of no sleep, and was likely due to other reasons at the time (planning a big trip, car issues, family drama etc). After that week, it became a recurring anxiety during the day of whether I would be able to fall asleep that night, which of course led to me not getting any (or maybe a few hours) of sleep. Eventually, enough was enough and I contacted my psychiatrist and was prescribed 50 mg trazodone. For me, it has worked like a charm and knocked me out every time (except when I took a half (25mg) pill which did not work at all).

Since then, I have somehow gained like 8 lbs very rapidly. No other aspect of my life has changed. I am very active, and typically only have two meals a day. After meeting with my psychiatrist and bring up this concern, she explained that the dosage (50 mg) shouldn't be enough to have that effect. Has anybody else experienced this?

428,"Sudden insomnia + joint pain making me miserable Tonight has been my 8th consecutive night of insomnia and 5th night of severe joint pain. I (21M) have never had a hard time sleeping before. I've always been someone who not only could fall asleep eventually, but is a very deep sleeper. Some nights I've gotten 1 or 2 hours of sleep but most nights I've gotten no sleep at all. I've probably gotten 6 hours of sleep in total over the past 8 nights.

I've visited and talked to two different doctors who say it is likely due to the Bactrim antibiotic course I was on since I don't have a history of insomnia and nothing in my life has drastically changed. However, my Bactrim prescription ended on Sunday and my sleep has not improved at all. 

After my first 3 days of insomnia, I decided to video call a doctor who prescribed me with 150 mg of Trazodone. The medication had no effect on me and the next day I found that I had extreme joint and muscle aches. I'm not sure if those were due to exhaustion from lack of sleep or if it was from the medication, but I decided not to take the Trazodone again since it didn't even put me to sleep to begin with. The joint aches have continued ever since, and are debilitating to the point where it's extremely painful just to lie in bed. 

After my 6th night of insomnia, I decided that I wanted to see a doctor in person, so I scheduled to see a doctor near my house. He prescribed to me 15 mg of Meloxicam for my pain and 10 mg of Ambien. I also got blood work done and am awaiting the results. The Meloxicam feels like it has no effect on my pain and the Ambien put me to sleep for 1 hour but after that I could not go back to sleep.

With each day that my insomnia and pain continue, I feel more and more despondent. It scares me that neither of the sleep medication that were prescribed to me could give me relief and I have an irrational fear that my sleeping will never be the same again.

Didn’t sleep for more than two to three hours.

My doctor prescribed trazodone. At first, I didn’t take it because I was scared of the side effects. I tried OTC sleep aids. They worked but my rest was not like it use to be. I felt like I had slept deeply.

This year I still struggled but I slept a few hours at night. In April, I started stressing out again. The insomnia returned. I also have other symptoms like headaches. I’m wondering if the insomnia might be returning or getting worse not only from anxiety but also from abnormal brain activity.

I don’t have the type of seizures you lose consciousness. I’m fully alert. 

I started taking trazodone earlier this month. I was desperate. I’m able to sleep but I no longer feel tired during the day. That scares me. That’s not how I use to feel. I have been working remotely. I think lack of sunlight and exercise might be causing or triggering the insomnia. Any advice on what I can do to try to sleep better without meds. 

The longest I haven’t slept is two to three weeks.",Trazodone
431,"How long does it take for the drowsiness to go away once quitting Trazodone? So, long story short my Dr. prescribed me Trazodone for sleep a couple of months ago & i’d say a few weeks in, i realized that it was causing me extreme next day drowsiness. It was a battle getting out of bed every morning & to maintain any focus throughout the day. Needless to say, i continued taking it hoping that my body would adjust & also because it WAS giving me more hours of sleep, even though it never felt like i was well rested. 

Recently, i decided to taper off & quit under my Drs guidance. I went from 75 to 0 mg over the course of 3 weeks. Today is just my 2nd day being completely off of it, so my question was how soon i could expect that next day drowsiness to go away, I surprisingly slept ok last night even though it took me later than usual to fall asleep. Just wondering because I’m really looking forward to feeling normal again or somewhat normal before i began taking this medication. I feel like my brain chemistry is completely off/foggy. Sorry it’s just frustrating.

438,"How to ask my doctor for Ambien/Lunesta I have a very unique situation dealing with insomnia. I am 18 years old and have been on Trazodone, Seroquel, Remeron, and Benadryl (at different times) for 6 years now. Currently I take 100mg of Trazodone and 75mg of Benadryl. The side effects are unbearable and the medication only works half of the time. I need to get off.

I am currently seeing a sleep CBT therapist, practicing good sleep hygiene, and exercising daily in order to tire myself out. It feels like my body cannot fall asleep naturally. 

The reason I think Ambien or Lunesta would benefit me right now is because the half-life of both are relatively short compared to the 11 hour half-life of Trazodone. I have had very scary hallucinations from sleep deprivation and Benadryl, and I feel like shit every morning. These medications cause me to sleep for 11-12 hours and still wake up feeling exhausted.

Even if Ambien or Lunesta won’t magically improve the quality of my sleep, I think it would be much better to have a medication that is out of my body by the time I wake up. This would mean I don’t have to sleep for so long, even if I still feel kind of shitty when I wake up. 

My goal is to work with my sleep therapist and get off all medication in a few months. Please, unless it is actually helpful, don’t tell me that I am too young for Ambien or Lunesta. I know that they are not long-term solutions, but I am only sleeping every other day now and I need a solution to getting off this shitty medication ASAP.",Trazodone

I tried a very small amount of Trazodone that my doctor prescribed (12.5mg).  It put me to sleep but I was wide awake within an hour or two and then could not sleep.  The next night I could not sleep one bit at all. As everytime I seemed to fall asleep my neck tremor would act up and I would get a strong pulsing sensation in my head.  My body would shake sometimes.  By the way I also suffer from visual snow which is so poorly understood, but I wonder if Trazodone aggravated all this.

447,"8 months. Cant find Help [30M] 5’8” 145#
Going on my eighth month of insomnia and no end in sight. I am at a lost at what to do…
Feels like Ive done everything. Drugs, Therapy, all sorts of Testing and nothing, nobody can tell me anything or provide me any help.
I have both onset and maintenance insomnia. I get about 2-3 hours of fragmented sleep a night. Sometimes Ill go a couple days before I can get any sleep. Sleeping use to be my super power until October of 2020 and then boom I can’t sleep at all. It happened during a pretty intense bout of health anxiety and I have never recovered.
Ive tried Melatonin, Teas, Weed, Ambien, Benzos, SSRIs, Trazodone, Lunesta; & nothing works. Harder stuff might put me out but Id be up in a couple hours. Basically sugar pills to me. 
Ive tried working out to an excess, sleep hygiene, talk therapy, CBTi, sleep restriction therapy, acceptance therapy. I don’t know what to say, therapy just doesn’t work for me, especially when I feel like most therapists don’t know what they’re doing. The “good” ones are never accepting patients; go figure. 
Then Ive done all sorts of testing. All sorts of Blood work, EKGs, Brain MRI, Lyme Testing twice, Two sleep studies (at home and in lab), and work ups with all sorts of specialists. And nothing, apparently nothing is wrong. Some blame it on anxiety, others push pills, and most just stare off into oblivion and babble off unrelated anythings to justify their medical degrees and the siphoning of my bank account. Sorry for the sarcasm but you get the point. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t mean to scare anyone with this post as I realize Im a rather extreme case and most people on this sub think insomnia is having a bad couple days of sleep. But fuck me, Im at rock bottom I cant do this shit anymore. I will not be one of those guys who goes decades without sleep. Any extreme recovery cases out there? Please, looking for help and direction; not, “Im fucked too welcome to the club” with a virtual high five. Again, Im not a dick Im just trying to lighten the mood while venting some frustration.

449,"New here but have a question about medicine! Hey everyone! I'm new here but I want to know if anyone has any personal experience with this.

I take antidepressants/anxiety medication to help me sleep. I haven't been able to physically fall asleep on my own in well over 15 years. I've been on prescription medicine to make me sleep since before I was a teenager (I'm 29 now).

I was on Seroquel (Quetiapine) since around 2015 because trazodone stopped working (150mg). I got up to 400mg and in recent months, it stopped working. It originally stopped working due to my stomach becoming partially paralyzed (Gastroperisis), so when I got a feeding tube, I'd take it through it and it would work. Well, for a few months now, it started to stop working again. I recently went to my doctor and he switched me to Mirtazapine. We had trouble finding a medicine that was right for me. I've had it for a few days but I haven't tried it yet because I'm afraid that I'll have a bad reaction.

Backstory about being afraid of having a bad reaction: 
I was put on Amitriptyline to see if it would stop the pain I had from my Gastroperisis. I took it once and I had a really bad reaction to it. It made me constantly pass out and I fell so hard in my bathroom that I hurts the whole right side of my body. I'm afraid that the Mirtazapine is going to do the same. My doctor spent some time making sure that the Mirtazapine was in a different drug class than Amitriptyline.

Anyways, long story short: has anyone been on both Seroquel and Mirtazapine? Can you please tell me what each did for you?

I really want to get off the Seroquel, not only because it doesn't work, but because I'd occasionally get hallucinations and pass out (don't think it's fully due to medicine, but idk). I can do all the Googling in the world, but I'd love to hear people's personal experiences with each. Even if you never were on Seroquel, how does the Mirtazapine work for you?

Sorry for this long post! I just need to know what this drug does and what side effects people have had with it before I try it.

I was lucky the previous night & slept back again but only for an hour, last night I don’t think I did at all even though time flew by.

I have had insomnia since I was 5, and I started medication when I was 12. I was put on Trazodone and my dose increased until it was 150mg. When that stopped working, I was given Seroquel, and then Remeron, and now Benadryl with Trazodone again.

My quality of sleep is painfully bad. I wake up after a solid 12 hours of being asleep and still feel exhausted. I physically cannot get out of bed before that and I am insanely drowsy and irritable when I force myself to. 

Trazodone is not approved by the FDA for insomnia. Even worse, Benadryl builds tolerance pretty quickly after daily usage and my current dose does not work. Half the times I take the medication, I end up staying up all night anyways. I practice good sleep hygiene and exercise during the day. On days when I wasn’t able to sleep the night before, I am barely able to exercise without feeling like I might pass out.

My current doctor raised my ADHD medication doses after I hadn’t taken it for 2 months due to the sleep issues. I’m sorry, but how does that make any sense? Stimulants are schedule 2 which are the most high-risk for abuse drugs permitted to be used in a medical setting. Ambien and other Z-drugs are schedule 4. If they are so afraid of me getting addicted, why raise my dose of a highly addictive medication?

I’m frustrated and feel like giving up on finding answers. My life is horrible and most of my issues seem to be the result of not sleeping. I am terrified that I won’t be able to sleep tonight after taking my medication.

It has gotten so bad that I started drinking every night just to make sure that I at least slept for a little bit. I hate drinking and rarely do so, but I feel hopeless now. I’m literally so let down by the healthcare system and nobody tries to understand my situation.

453,"Advice for People Recovering Hey y’all, so I’ve been recovering from insomnia over the past two months, and can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I’d just like to give some advice for people who are stuck or just starting.

Where I was- 2 hours of sleep a night and was going crazy.

Where I am - 5-7 (semi fragmented) hours a night and my functions are coming back. I still have bad nights (like last night) but i try not to stress about it anymore.

1. Don’t focus on automatically being better - one problem I had was catastrophizing whenever my sleep would regress one night. Improvement with insomnia isn’t something that fixes fast, it’s a progression over time. Look to how you felt two weeks or a month ago, not the day before. 

2. Meds aren’t the devil - I was hesitant to start Trazodone at first, but it definitely did help me sleep 20% better which lifted my spirits. Do something if you feel stuck. 

3. You might have anxiety and/or depression - I saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with both. I tried antidepressants at first to no avail. I’m on 5 HTP now and my anxiety, depression and sleep all improved to a noticeable extent. All of these issues are linked as well. Solve one, the others will get better. 

4. Look for enjoyable things to do - with depression and insomnia during this, I had difficult time enjoying anything. Finding those little things can make life a bit less shitty.

5. You’ll get better - the most frustrating thing for me during this was that my brain just didn’t work as well. My memory was gone and I was scared. It’s come back to maybe 70% now and knowing that it gets better makes one more hopeful. I thought I was fucked.

The month or so I have felt tired about 10-11pm, gotten into bed and maybe read for an hour. I fall asleep and then wake up 1-2 hours later being unable to go back to sleep. Sometimes it's caused by the pain in my legs, other times I feel like I just physically am unable to sleep. If I get out of bed I am just groggy, irritated and want to sleep. But as soon as I get in bed I can't sleep. 

I am usually lying awake up to 4 hours at a time and it's getting ridiculous. I have assumed this is not insomnia as I can sleep later in the day, about 11-12pm and onwards. But when it's night I suffer greatly. I was told it was called sleep anxiety by my therapist but I have no idea how to deal with that. It doesn't make sense to me that I can sleep in the day no problem (most the time) but not at night. 

It's currently 4am and I am supposed to be up at 7, I feel so done with this.",Amitriptyline
462,"Amitriptyline for sleep Hi everyone 

Two weeks ago I was prescribed 10mg Amitriptyline for sleep. I found 10mg didn’t help so I started taking 20mg. For the first week of taking 20mg I was sleeping really well but for the past few nights my sleep has been pretty bad. 
I have a couple of questions:
1 is it possible to build up a tolerance to Amitriptyline? 
2 if I were to take 25mg or 30mg would this be more helpful? I’m pretty sure at higher doses there is no longer a sedative effect but I’m not sure what the threshold is 
Thanks in advance:)",Amitriptyline
463,"Didn’t sleep at all last night and now I’m an anxious mess. Hello, I haven’t posted here in a while. I thought I was getting a better grasp on healthy sleep and I have for a while. It’s been at least 10 months since I’ve gone a whole night without any sleep. I started taking amitriptyline for chronic headaches but it also helps me feel sleepy. I ended up moving into a friends house for about 5 months and with the medication along with my new bed and the peace and quiet I had, I’ve been falling asleep normally between 12-3am. Now my mom and I just moved in with a family member in a different state 2 days ago. It’s a temporary thing, just a couple months. I no longer have the bed I was using. I no longer have peace and quiet as I now need to sleep with both cats in my room because the person we’re living with doesn’t like cats. One of my cats is all over the place and there’s never any peace with him. He’s very nocturnal and won’t leave me alone. I was drifting off to sleep last night around 1am and he started up his shenanigans. So I switched with my mom who was sleeping on the couch and I just couldn’t fall asleep. 

I was up the entire night. Not a single minute of sleep. It’s noon here and I’ve been awake since around 7am yesterday. I’m an anxious wreck and I just keep crying. This happened every single time I got zero sleep. I’d just be anxious all day and feel sick and cry. I do have bad anxiety in general, and whenever I don’t sleep for a whole night my brain goes into super worry mode and automatically thinks I won’t sleep again this following night. 

I just don’t know what to do. I miss my bed time sanctuary. I slept for a few hours on the day we arrived. So idk maybe it was just a random bad night. But I just don’t know what to do. My cat keeps me up. The woman we’re living with is up in the living room with the tv on until 11-11:30pm. The couch sucks. The floor sucks. I’m honestly considering making a little bed with lots of blankets in the big walk in closet in my bedroom (that I have to share with my mom btw) this way I don’t need to deal with the cats but I also don’t need to be disturbed in the living room. (Lady gets up around 3:30-4am for work). But right now I’ve been an anxious mess and crying on and off for 2 hours. 

Context: a long long time ago I had a very very bad battle of insomnia where I was awake for 3 whole days without sleep and it was the worst thing I ever had to go through. This is why my brain always goes into fear mode whenever I don’t sleep for a whole night because I’m afraid it’ll be like that time again. It’ll be over 40 hours until I can sleep again.

I thought I was going to be able to actually get maybe 5 or 6 hours of sleep last night because I was so tired from working but I was very wrong, I actually got less sleep than the previous night. 
There’s no way I would’ve been able to make it through a 9 hour day so I called in on my 2nd day. I feel so guilty and ashamed for it. I was prescribed amitriptyline but I ran out and my script is on hold until November 8th, this has been the only thing to actually get me to sleep but I don’t have any. 
I’m debating on if I should even start this new job because I know I am not going to sleep properly until I get my meds. 
I have to go in tomorrow and I am so scared that tonight is just going to be the same thing again. I’ve tried Benadryl, unisom, melatonin, sleepy tea, and THC and nothing works.

I was prescribe Amitriptyline only to have horrible side effects.  I felt like I was being suffocated I couldn't breath. This med, that is also used for migraines, actually *gave* me a headache.

After some research I find out the name brand of this drug was  pulled of the market (Elavil) due to heart problems. I still don't understand how a medicine can be discontinued due to health reasons, yet the generic version can be prescribed for a ton of different problems.

Even otc benadryl and sleep aides have been linked to dementia.

470,"Barely any sleep for 2 weeks, never happened before Hi, Thank you for taking the time to help me

First off, I'm french, living in France.  I have no particular medical history, allergies or other issues worth mentioning beyond the fact that I lead a classic sedentary city life, working from home on the computer, little exercise, too much sugar, overweight...3 of my grandparents had cancers (bladder & colon/stomach) in case that matters.

In the past I've only ever not slept at all in very stressful times, notably the day before an important test and whatnot, and even that was fairly rare, and hasn't happened for a decade or so. I'm not stressed at all nowadays, aside from my current sleeping issue. Beyond that, I generally take a while to fall asleep, although I believe this is at least in part due to the aforementionned lifestyle, snacking during the evening and/or turning off the pc and going immediately to bed.

After spending a few days with my parents 3 weeks ago, I arrived back home, nothing unusual happened, nothing stressful in my life (probably better than most of the time in fact), and that same night I couldn't sleep, laid awake the whole night or near enough. Same thing happens the following days, I'm just awake in bed and sleep doesn't come. I don't even necessarily feel tired either most of the time, even the days I've done a decent amount of exercise.

I go to a doctor after a week and explain my issues, and am told to take a pill of Stresam ( Etifoxine ) & a few drops of Laroxyl ( Amitriptyline ) before bed for 2 weeks. After reading the notices and looking up the molecules on wikipedia I'm a bit worried, and ask my aunt (psychologist) & father (vet) about it, and they both strongly recommend not to take the Amitriptyline unless I tried other things before, it being a major antidepressant with serious side effects and with a risk of ""addiction"". I trie the Etifoxine alone for a few days, it does nothing, then a ""sleeping pill"" called Donormyl (Doxylamine) that my aunt recommended, also nothing. I've also improved my routine during the last week, no screen for a couple hours before bed, more exercise. No effect.

I've googled around and am worried about what to do next, I've _NEVER_ had anything like that happened before. As I've mentionned, I'm barely sleeping at all every single night for the last 2 weeks, maybe an hour to 90 minutes but it can't really be more than that. I'm worried of the antidepressant, especially since it takes a long time to take effect apparently, and the various alternatives I could seek (polysomnography tests...) seem both expensive and not necessarily relevant or reliable for my issue...

Considering taking appointments with a psychiatrist, maybe a neurologist, my aunt also recommends a sophrologist or hypnotherapist but I don't know what to think about those...Any advice would be welcome.",Amitriptyline
471,"Prescribed Valproate ER for insomnia with no history of bipolar disorder and on ADHD medicine? I have a history of primarily anxiety based insomnia, although obviously I couldn't take Adderall free of any other medications an hour before bed and fall asleep, it's otherwise not directly linked to my insomnia in my years of experience of taking it. I can skip it on an anxiety ridden day and still stay up the entire night mind racing, I can have an exciting fulfilling day with no major anxiety stressors and still fall asleep  before midnight having had 500mg of caffeine throughout the day along with my typical dosage of Adderall.

Trazodone and Amitriptyline were a disaster and a larger disaster each, as I literally could wake up after sleeping 12 hours, take an adderall to hopefully wake up, and sleep another 4 hours afterwards the Amitriptyline was so inhibiting that after taking it the night before the result of forgetting to take my Adderall  before work to help counteract it was literally falling asleep on my feet and then getting a DUI on my lunch break. That's not a problem I've ever had caused by simply skipping the adderall.

Ambien worked, if I was already half way relaxed and fell asleep in that 1 hour window, otherwise by the time I'd feel the anxiety slipping away, I'd start feeling the sedation lift as well. So now I finally gave into the relentless urging to try some kind of anti psychotic or bipolar medication such as seroquel and accepted Valproate as an option. Now I see she prescribed the more expensive, and much more likely to render my unfunctional the next day extended release version.

From my point of view it sounds like the exact opposite kind of medication someone who needs Adderall to concentrate should be on and a poor solution for anxiety at it's worst when I lack energy and feel depressed thus unable to handle the things that keep me up at night.

Is there a chance that these issues and drugs won't clash and that it'll work fantastic for sleep yet not impair me during the day? Or is this like it seems to me probably a very bad combination.",Amitriptyline

475,"I have insomnia twice and I found out what caused it So back in 2020 I suddenly developed a terrible insomnia which lasted for a long time and caused me to take a longggg no pay leave at work. I went like 5 days without sleep once and was zombie like most of the time. I saw different doctors and they gave me different medications with no help whatsoever.. until I was referred to a psychiatrist at a hospital and I was grateful that she got to the bottom of it and found out what was causing my insomnia.

It turns out that the decongestants I had been taking over the years was the culprit as I have a history of allergic rhinitis. There's this chemical called pseudoephedrine found in decongestants which causes you to be sleepy at night. I usually take Fedac before bedtime for my blocked nose everyday for almost a whole year. This caused my brain to become used to pseudoephedrine which caused my insomnia. Solution? My psychiatrist gave me 1mg of Prothiaden to take at night and helps me to sleep, while I stop taking Fedac or any other decongestants during this time of treatment. After 2 weeks of taking 1mg of Prothiaden, I went back to the psychiatrist to thank her! I was able to sleep again naturally for 6 mths so I stopped taking any medication until...

... Recently 2021 while out of the blue, I developed insomnia againnnn. I didn't take any decongestants or sleeping pills as advised by my psychiatrist during the past 6 mths. So I made an appointment to see her and once again, she found out why I was unable to sleep. The culprit turned out to be nasal spray this time! Since I was not able to take Fedac or any decongestants, I still have allergies and I used nasal spray like Afrin to clear my blocked nose.. turns out nasal sprays contain pseudoephedrine too and I have been using it for many times. Solution? My psychiatrist gave me 1mg of Amitriptyline to take before sleep while advising me not to take any decongestants or use nasal sprays. I was able to sleep with the help of Amitriptyline. But last night I forgot to take a pill and Guess what! I'm able to fall asleep on my own but I woke up many times throughout the night, but it's better than not being able to fall asleep. I'm still on my treatment now and my psychiatrist is reducing my dosage gradually.

Also, since I live in an Asian country, Chinese doctors also known as TCM are well known to help cure insomnia too. So I did went to see a TCM physician and he advised that I am too 'heaty' as I have been eating lots of fried and unhealthy food. So the solution from him is that I should stop eating 'heaty' foods and drink more 'cooling' teas such as ginseng, chrysanthemum and fruits to name a few. You may Google on cooling and heaty foods if you are unfamiliar with TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine).

So far, I had stopped eating 'heaty' foods and I'm taking the 1mg Amitriptyline my psychiatrist prescribed to me and it seems like I'm recovering. I hope my advice and sleep journey my be of help to anyone reading this if the cause of your insomnia may be pseudoephedrine and 'heaty' foods.",Amitriptyline

478,"Insomnia for the past 12 years. Been on every medicine available. Finally found a fix. Bring all of your skepticism, I understand, but its real and has turned my life around. 30yo male here. Had pretty bad insomnia since I was 18. 

Here's a TLDR; for those that don't want to read the wall of text below: 
10 years of life disrupting insomnia, 2 years of life ending insomnia. Have taken nearly all available prescriptions to try to sleep. Few worked, all came with side effects eventually that worsened my health. While trying to repair the damage that chronic multi-day long sleeplessness created, I stumbled upon a cheap and readily available cure for all of my issues including my insomnia. A peptide called GHRP6. I would put it under my tongue at night, eat a huge meal, and then become intensely tired. First time in my adult life I slept like a fucking rock. It has been 4 months and it has been only consistent success. Totally safe to take for as long as you want. And comes with the added benefit of increase healing, anti-aging, etc.

---------

I have two main causes of my insomnia, basically. First is, I have racing thoughts. Will replay the day, the past week, year, decade, etc in my head. Can't clear my mind and fall asleep. Second, I have a crazy adrenaline response. If I hear a noise, my adrenaline spikes and my heart pounds. If I am having trouble falling asleep, then I get nervous that I am going to have a shitty day the next day, so then my heart start racing and then I don't sleep because of it... etc. 

at 22yo I took trazodone and it definitely made me sleep if I stayed with an ever increasing dose. It gave me brain fog, short term memory issues, a few other side effects which were serious enough to where I had to get off of it. 

I started taking vyvanse for work after I graduated college, and it did not worsen my insomnia from what it was until about age 26. 

At age 26, I would go atleast 1 night a week without sleeping at all, and then a few days with 4-5 hours of sleep. The vyvanse made it to where it wasn't really an issue to deal with though.

At 27 I got on Ambien, then lunesta, hydroxizine, a few other benzos, amitriptyline, and a few others. Lunesta was the only one that did anything, and I slept well for a while. It eventually stopped working, and about 16 months ago, I went into a serious dark bottomless pit of insomnia.

At 29, roughly 16mo ago, I went through a period of time, while on lunesta, where I wouldnt sleep for up to 5 days. Not your typically, rolling around, falling in and out of a shallow sleep and then telling people you didnt sleep at all ... I mean stare at the fucking ceiling for 5 hours and then get up and go to work, for 5 days in a row. This lasted for about 4 months until my body and brain gave out on me. I developed an anxiety disorder. I had lost like 20lbs. I had circulation issues. Stomach ulcers. gastritis. IBS. I couldn't focus at all. I couldn't work. 

I focus first on the anxiety issues, which lead to SSRIs and SNRIs which made everything 1000 times worse. My sleeping became worse. etc.  

So then I switched to trying to treat the gastro issues. After diagnosing stomach ulcers and gastritis and IBS, they put me on PPIs and a few other things, none of which helped. Only made it worse. So I did a bit of my own research and came across a few medical studies on peptides, which led me to BPC 157 which is a peptide for healing. This helped briefly, but wierdly enough, it made me sleep very well for about a week then it went away.

So after that semi successful run of a peptide I bought off the internet. I looked into others. I read another medical journal about GHRP 6, which is a mimic of a peptide your body creates that tells your body when its hungry and ready to eat. It also helps release your own human growth hormone. I started taking that in order to help stimulate my appetite and bring blood flow to my GI tract and initiate healing. And it worked like a fucking charm. I was eating more than I had in forever, and my stomach issues were rapidly improving. But the one thing that increased more than anything else..... MY SLEEP. 

Before I started these peptides, I got off sleep medicine, because any pill was hurting my gastritis. I obviously struggled with that and dealt with worsening insomnia, but I pushed through it. 

I upgraded the course of GHRP6 that I was taking to include another peptide that further increases your own human growth hormone production, called CJC1295 (no dac), and have been taking those two 1-2 times a day for the past 3-4 months. I am back on my vyvanse, I also drink caffeine again (which I quit for 7 years due to insomnia), and I am sleeping better than I have in my whole life. I actually get tired at night, I lay down, and I am out. I may wake up to piss or eat a snack, but back to bed until proper rise-n-shine time.  

I have been working out for the past 4 months, which is something I havent done consistently in 7 years due to no having the energy and not being able to drink caffeine. I have gain ~30lbs back that I lost from my rock-bottom era 16 months ago. 

The best part is, this peptide is something that you can take for as long as you want. It does not downregulate your own ghrelin or GH production and you do not develop a tolerance for it. And the cherry on top is, your growth hormone blood levels are increase to 3-4x their normal levels, so your skin is younger, hair is longer and thicker, nails are more healthy, your body heals faster, and your muscles in theory repair faster. It basically makes you feel younger.

Would also like to give a shout out to Clonidine and Guanfacine. Those are 2 medicines that are called alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. They are technically blood pressure medicines, but they are also prescribed for ADHD. They also happen to boost your own natural human growth hormone. I started taking them a few months back, and they tone down my adrenaline response. At the beginning of this post, I mentioned that my adrenaline response was too strong and it kept me up at night with a beating heart. This eliminates that and calms my mind. Really helps with the whole insomnia thing.

479,"New here but have a question about medicine! Hey everyone! I'm new here but I want to know if anyone has any personal experience with this.

I take antidepressants/anxiety medication to help me sleep. I haven't been able to physically fall asleep on my own in well over 15 years. I've been on prescription medicine to make me sleep since before I was a teenager (I'm 29 now).

I was on Seroquel (Quetiapine) since around 2015 because trazodone stopped working (150mg). I got up to 400mg and in recent months, it stopped working. It originally stopped working due to my stomach becoming partially paralyzed (Gastroperisis), so when I got a feeding tube, I'd take it through it and it would work. Well, for a few months now, it started to stop working again. I recently went to my doctor and he switched me to Mirtazapine. We had trouble finding a medicine that was right for me. I've had it for a few days but I haven't tried it yet because I'm afraid that I'll have a bad reaction.

Backstory about being afraid of having a bad reaction: 
I was put on Amitriptyline to see if it would stop the pain I had from my Gastroperisis. I took it once and I had a really bad reaction to it. It made me constantly pass out and I fell so hard in my bathroom that I hurts the whole right side of my body. I'm afraid that the Mirtazapine is going to do the same. My doctor spent some time making sure that the Mirtazapine was in a different drug class than Amitriptyline.

Anyways, long story short: has anyone been on both Seroquel and Mirtazapine? Can you please tell me what each did for you?

I really want to get off the Seroquel, not only because it doesn't work, but because I'd occasionally get hallucinations and pass out (don't think it's fully due to medicine, but idk). I can do all the Googling in the world, but I'd love to hear people's personal experiences with each. Even if you never were on Seroquel, how does the Mirtazapine work for you?

Sorry for this long post! I just need to know what this drug does and what side effects people have had with it before I try it.

485,"Everything I know about insomnia **Everything I know about Chronic Insomnia:**

Here are a lot of my thoughts on insomnia, that I have written over the last two years while I worked on curing my chronic insomnia. It’s long, but then again so is the process of battling insomnia. I was going to post this as a response to a specific topic but actually I thought I might as well start a separate thread. In the interest of full disclosure, I was diagnosed with chronic insomnia on top of GAD, and went through ACT therapy with added help from Amitriptyline - a sedative antidepressant. Before this I tried just about everything: ignoring it until it goes away, sleeping pills, Benzos, trazodone, Seroquel, Mirtazapine, Lyrica... to no avail. 

&#x200B;

A lot of the points below is from personal research, and help from my psychiatrist. I really hope they will give some sufferers hope, relief, and a good base to start on to get through this mental health issue. 

Insomnia is essentially a phobia of sleep. It is caused by one of the most ancient parts of your mind in evolutionary terms, the amygdala, which is responsible for your fear responses, and fight or flight mode. It’s also part of our subconscious, ie we do not have a way to rationally control it as it highjacks the rational part of our brain. 

\-There are two main therapy approaches to curing insomnia:

\-CBT: 

Here you look to change your negative thought patterns around sleep, and replace them with new positive thoughts around sleep. In order to rekindle the equation bed = sleep in the subconscious part of your mind, CBT also imposes a strict regimen including exercise every day, sleep restriction, and getting out of bed every time you can’t fall asleep in 20 mins.

This method works, but over all, studies seem to show on the long term it is less beneficial than ACT (see below). For people with naturally sceptical minds, it’s not easy to change negative thoughts by a simple rational process. I had trouble with this myself.

\-ACT and mindfulness.

Here you look at both noticing your negative thinking patterns, and accepting the discomfort stemming from both the negative thoughts and emotions around sleep, and around the tiredness during the day. 

\-First, It’s important to realise that you cannot control the thoughts that go through your mind - however, it is possible to control how you react to them. A natural human response is to try and immediately shut down thoughts that lead to negative sensations or discomfort. For eg, if I tell you that tomorrow when you get in your car to go to work, you might have an accident and die - your mind automatically discards this possibility as unreasonable, and it works. However when an anxiety disorder is developed, this process doesn’t work anymore and becomes part of the problem: the more you try to avoid and / or shutdown powerful negative thoughts, the more they come back and the stronger they become.

With ACT, over time, you learn to welcome and accept negative thoughts instead of fighting them. This sounds impossible but it’s not. There have been many, many nights before you developed insomnia where you probably got short sleep by choice: decided to stay up late to watch a film or talk to someone, decided to go out late before a school / work day, or just having sex with a partner etc… And it never bothered you: proof that you can know that you will be tired tomorrow, or not sleep well tonight, and be ok with it.

This is very powerful because once you start putting this into practice, with time you improve, and after a period of time, you actually enable your mind to be in a relaxed enough state to finally find sleep. It is counterintuitive, but if you think about it, when you didn’t have any sleep problems, if you’d gone to bed and you thought about what if you didn’t fall asleep or slept only a few hours etc… ie all the negative thoughts you currently get: you would still have slept a normal night back then, because it wouldn’t have triggered the anxiety response that keeps you awake today. The point is it is possible to go to sleep while having these thoughts, so long as your reaction to these thoughts doesn’t trigger anxiety.

ACT also recommends that you assign a name, an image to your negative sleep thoughts. For example for myself I chose to label my insomnia as my ‘Insomnia bear’. Bears hibernate all winter and when they come out in Spring, they are groggy, hungry and in a bad mood. When I notice my negative thoughts coming in, I see them as a grumpy bear, and I lie in bed and imagine myself taming the bear, and cuddling it… with time this helped me feel comfortable and put a smile on my face. 

Lastly, turning pain into purpose can help you alleviate the pain. For example, if instead of relating completely negatively with your insomnia you change your view on how you look at it, and manage to see it in a positive light, it will help get over the discomfort. Your initial thought while reading this is probably that this is just mental: how can there be any positives with insomnia? 

For me, what really started my insomnia was stimulant drugs use and big long nights partying. For a while I tried to cure the insomnia to be able to go back to living like I did before. It worked for a while but inevitably came back. In the end, I decided to see my insomnia as my mind telling me to pursue a more fulfilling life: I didn’t do loads of sport just in order to cure the insomnia, but instead my insomnia was the reason that led me to drastically improve my fitness by focusing on a healthier lifestyle (I wouldn’t have if I hadn’t had sleep issues). I learnt a lot about my own psychology thanks to insomnia - something I had never cared about before, and which has helped me improve performance everywhere including at work and in my relationships with friends. I am more in tune with my emotions and more empathetic towards others than before. After years of partying and not having any serious meaningful relationships, I finally settled down with a girl I love. 

In terms of how long it takes, everyone is different, and ACT is not easy to implement: it’s more of long term strategy. Usually people start noticing a difference after 4-6 weeks when it comes to their sleep, and a study by the sleep school shows sleep continues to improve over a period of a year. Essentially, your sleep comes back to an acceptable level (say 5-6h / night) within several weeks, but then the last hour or two is longer to get, as it is less physically ‘needed’ by your mind and body: you feel a bit tired during the day but sleep drive isn’t as strong as when you were sleeping just a few hours a night.

A few more tips and thoughts:

\-A premise to getting better is to understand there is nothing physically wrong with you, and you will sleep normally again one day. I was super scared originally as a brain MRI showed an anomaly that could have been a blood clot - which, considering my drug use, could have meant there was something physically wrong. My GP and psychiatrist disagreed with this though, and in time I managed to get over this fright.

Thought processes:

Above I talk about how, when a thought generates discomfort, we tend to try and block the thoughts out of our mind, and how this doesn’t work once negative thoughts reach a certain power, after which it snowballs the other way. It took me a long time to realise this and even today, I still do it a bit. Whenever something scary pops into my mind, I just think - no, don’t think about it. 

For the insomnia, I changed this habit and actually forced myself to think about it during the day: essentially it’s the concept of exposure therapy if you like. I think about it in a ‘safe’ and pleasant setting, and it would help me think about sleep without losing control of my thoughts. So for example, take a few times a day (morning, lunch, evening?) where you sit with your own thoughts and dedicate some time to thinking about sleep. Tell yourself a positive story on sleep, so that you look forward to going to bed. In other words, fake it till you make it (more on positive thoughts that helped me below).

Another trick: Looking forward to the discomfort. This is sort of related to finding the meaning in the discomfort explained above. 

For example: you’ve got a big event tomorrow - something stressful at work, or an important date, or a social event you want to be on form for. You’re anxious, you know you won’t sleep well. And that’s the truth: you won’t; and yes, you will be at least a little tired tomorrow. But I’ve found that sometimes by going to bed ‘knowing’ that it’s not going to be a good night, and not hoping that I’ll sleep, the night turns out to be better than expected. 

Sleep is essentially a performance anxiety: if you went to bed every night not expecting to sleep and you literally did not care whether you fell asleep or not, you’d sleep again within weeks. If you trick your mind into thinking that’s it’s perfectly OK to lie awake in bed, and that actually resting and relaxing is fine and just as enjoyable, it’ll go a long way in helping you solve the problem. 

On the topic of anxiety in general, in many cases, the feeling generated by the thought of the bad thing happening is much worse than the actual feeling you get when the bad thing happens. When it comes to sleep: that tug of war to stop your mind from thinking about sleep, the pounding heart at 2am, the warm bursts that make you chuck you duvet off the bed because you’re sweating from the stress - isn’t that actually worse than just being tired the next day because you didn’t sleep enough? Think of all those nights where you were out late and had to do stuff the next day: did it make you want to cry from being overwhelmed?

The key here is that by relieving yourself of any hopes and expectations, you let go of any anxiety. This is actually one of the premises of Buddhism by the way, and is applicable to all forms of stress and anxiety. 

Meditation and mindfulness: This is just awesome, and so powerful. Patience is key here: you won’t see any difference in the first two weeks, and it will likely take months before you personally notice the difference - yet people around you may notice sooner. Essentially, meditation gives you perspective on your own thoughts. We rarely stop to think about what we are thinking or why we are thinking it. When your mind is broken into an unhealthy pattern, sitting with your own thoughts is a prerequisite to getting better. Other positives include stronger ability to concentrate, a calmer, relaxed energy, less anger and negative emotions etc…

Exercising is key, but don’t over do it. At mild doses, it helps boost your energy levels, but if you are sleeping 2-3h a night, it’s also draining in terms of energy. You don’t want to run down your entire metabolism, so listen to what your body is telling you. In fact, even if you were sleeping normally, would you try and exercise 1h a day 7 days a week? Unless you are a serious athlete, no - you’d be broken after two weeks. That’s also a part of the healing process: be nice to yourself, don’t judge yourself too harshly if you can’t run a half marathon after 2h sleep etc… It’s fine, there will be many opportunities, and patience is key. 

Caffeine: I never liked the Spartan approach of no caffeine until the problem is solved. It’s important not to drink too much coffee / coke etc, and not too late in the day, but if you really enjoy a cup of coffee as part of your morning routine, well… let yourself enjoy it! The caffeine is not the cause of chronic insomnia, and insomnia can go away without having to give it up.

Lastly, some positive thoughts that helped me overcome the nightmare:

\-Don’t be afraid of tiredness: it’s part of the healing process, as it’s just your mind and body working hand in hand to build your sleep drive.

\-There will be many more bad nights: that too is part of the healing process. Look forward to experiencing the discomfort of lying awake in bed.

\-It’s OK to be awake at night: simply focus on resting and relaxing, which is something within your control

\-Remember there is meaning in discomfort: getting used to bad nights and living a normal life despite the tiredness contributes to building character strength that you will benefit from your whole life. Aim to achieve as much as you can on whatever sleep you get.

\-Do not overthink bad nights: when you wake up, take some time to collect your thoughts before you crack on with your day, and then focus on putting all your energy into living your life and influencing things you have some control over, rather than wasting it worrying about something you can’t control. 

\-When negative thoughts come, don’t try and shut them down: try to notice, welcome and accept them. 

\-I’ve had many short nights before. In fact I’ve had nights where I’ve been out all night, didn’t sleep at all and had to travel or do something the next day. I felt bad but I got done whatever I needed to get done.

\-Is it really that bad? Think about the last 12 months. What do you remember of them? Is it just a series of panic attacks in bed? Probably not: you probably remember the fun, enjoyable moments. Holidays, moments with friends or family - on some of these days where I was knackered, I don’t remember being tired, I remember having fun: it shows it’s not as bad as our perception of the bloody thing.

\-Don’t let sleep anxiety get in the way of enjoying your life. That’s a problem I had with CBT: going to bed ALWAYS at the same time, is not always possible when you want to live a normal life: if it’s your mate’s birthday, it doesn’t matter if you’re not in bed by midnight and get back at 3am because you stayed out. Those memories are worth it. Don’t miss out on a holiday because you don’t want to be jet lagged. In a word, don’t try and avoid tiredness. 

\-I Actually sleep a lot better than I think. 

\-Don’t be worried or judge myself about taking medication: I should not set myself time limits, and should not focus on solving the sleep problem which has pretty much been solved. Instead, I should focus on the meaningful things in my life.

ACT is also extremely powerful tool because once you have learnt to implement it to cure insomnia, you can actually use it to fight other forms of anxiety in life.

If you’re interested on this topic, I would also recommend reading about Stoicism - a form of Ancient Greek philosophy which holds a lot of answers to some of the most meaningful questions we ask ourselves in periods of doubt and discomfort. 

We need to remember: life is a lot easier now than it was in the past and humans are incredibly resilient. For thousands of years we’ve lived in the world when child mortality rates were 50%, where famines, pandemics and wars came regularly and killed 20-50% of everyone we knew, and where people have survived concentration camps. For many of us, getting through insomnia is the hardest thing we’ll ever do

486,"Have you tried sedative antidepressants? Hey there, 

&#x200B;

So I had really bad insomnia for a year or so in 2018/19 (down from 7h normal sleep to 2-4h), eventually I caved and went to see a psychiatrist. We tried a few things (Lyrica and trazodone didn't work at all, Mirtazapine helped but I was KO the whole day after), and eventually I was put on Amitriptyline up to 100mg, which was too much so came back down to 50mg which was just right. Took a few weeks to help, after 6 weeks or so I was back to 6h / night which is when I knew I'd won. 

Weirdly my cousin also had serious issues with sleep that year (down to 2 straight nights with no sleep at all) and was prescribed mirtazapine which was a God send for her. Note that her psychiatrist also signed her off work for a month while antidepressants took effect: the argument was that to get to the point where she'd had no sleep for two consecutive nights, she had completely exhausted her central nervous system to the point where it wasn't a question of doing sport or walking around in the sun light: the first week was in a private clinic (essentially a room in a psychiatrist ward), before going through a slow mental rehab process with the help of medication. 

&#x200B;

I'm mentioning this as I've seen a few ppl post about not wanting to take medication. I find that there is still a stigma around psyche meds. Antidepressant are called as such because they are a primary care treatment for depression, but they are also offer help to manage anxiety and insomnia - although release will never be immediate. it's not just with the sleep part that it helps: it also helps organise your thoughts during the day and apply techniques for ACT and CBT for example. Neither myself or my cousin were ever diagnosed with depression - but to be honest, the awful sleep, the lack of motivation to do anything in the day and the ruminating thoughts around the sleep issue making us feel low are the top 3 symptoms of clinical depression (more common than 'feeling sad or low' according to my psychiatrist). 

&#x200B;

In my opinion this is at least worth a serious go: we all take meds when we get physically sick, so what's the problem with taking medication when we have a serious mental health issue (which insomnia is - let's face it). 

&#x200B;

I really hope some insomnia sufferers will find some help with these meds - can't imagine where I'd be if I hadn't been prescribed amitriptyline.

493,"Sharing my experience with Insomnia So, I'm new to writing reddit posts, but I finally decided to write about my own experience with insomnia and how I'm doing now. I don’t expect anyone to read this or even care for that matter, but this is something that I just want to get off my chest. I’ve felt a lot better, reading some stories in r/insomnia, knowing that there are others going through this. 

Heads up, this is probably going to be very long. Also, I'm shit at story-telling. **TL;DR at very bottom.**

So my insomnia began on August 26, 2019, the night before Senior year of high school. I had this bad habit of staying up the night before the first day so naturally, I stayed awake until 1 am until I finally decided that I was tired enough. But unlike the other nights, I could not, for the life of me, fall asleep. At first, I just rationalized that it was the stress of first day. I entered the first day of senior year without a wink of sleep.

I thought that that would be the last sleep deprived night I'd get. But no, the following night, I could only sleep for 2 hours. Then the following night 3. The next week followed the same pattern. And then the next month. And then before I realized, 6 months had passed without me getting more than 5 hours of sleep in a single night.

I didn't know what was wrong with me. I still don't. I'm 19 years old. Prior to insomnia, I was an athlete (BJJ, Judo). I was very social. I didn't drink but I did smoke. When the insomnia became a problem, I did everything I found online. Count numbers/sheep. Breath differently. Sleep earlier (9pm). Off electronics. Read. Workout. Tea. Nyquil. Melatonin/Benadryl. Etc. All of that barely made a difference but I still follow it to this day.

My parents don't understand. They just said that I needed to pray to God more and work-out more. I've never felt more alone that night. I broke down sobbing, thinking that no one could understand just how much insomnia was affecting me.

The first time I went to the doctor, he said that it was just in my head and just prescribed me melatonin/Benadryl. A couple months later, I revisit him and he continues to tell me it's in my head and just prescribes me a higher dosage of melatonin and Benadryl. I learned that day that doctors are fucking useless.

Melatonin and Benadryl are weird for me. For some reason, my body adept to medicine VERY quickly. The first time I tried mel and Benadryl, I slept for like 5 hours straight and I felt like a fucking God. But the more I used it, the less effective it was, and after a week, instead of feeling sleepy, I just felt nauseous and shitty.

Fast forward to August 2020. It had been a whole year since this had started. Insomnia has completely turned my life around. Waking up 5-6 times a night made me scared to sleep anywhere BUT my bed. I lost numerous friends due to me staying home and going to bed at 8 pm. I wasn't as athletic as before, due to sleep deprivation destroying my stamina and subsequently, my workout routine. My entire body felt so fucked. My nerves were on fire. My nose was constantly stuffy. I've read a couple stories where people have dealt with this for 10+ years. For people who have suffered with insomnia for that long, I can't begin to describe how much I fucking respect you.

A great breakthrough has happened in the month of November. On the last day of August, I went to see a different doctor after I realized that my usual doc was shit. She made me do a series of labs. Blood, hormones, thyroid, pee, she sent me to a lot of specified doctors to do a lot of tests.

But anyway, I was finally at my wits end. Recently I had begone to become incredibly depressed and started to have my first suicidal thoughts. I was embarrassed to tell anyone but I think my doctor could see right through me. It wasn't hard though, I looked like shit. My doctor prescribed me an anti-depressant called Amitriptyline (25 mg). And let me say, it's a fucking blessing.

My insomnia isn't gone or gotten significantly better, but it's the best thing that's helped my insomnia. I know that usually, it takes like 4+ weeks for you to notice effects, but I noticed it in my first night. Instead of waking up 5-6 times a night, only getting like 4-5 hours of sleep max, I've only gotten up 3 times a night, getting up to 7-8 hours of sleep at night. I cried. This has helped me so much in only so little time.

I started Amitriptyline (25 mg) on November 10, 2020. It's only been 10 days, but it's some of the best sleep I've gotten for over a year. If anyone has any questions, shoot, I'm happy to help anyone else going through this shit. I'll also try to keep weekly or bi-weekly updates.

**TL;DR** \- **Me telling how my insomnia started, and bitching about doctor and my shitty life. Insomnia makes me wake up 5-6 times a night accumulating only up to 4-5 hours a sleep a night. Regular medication doesn't do jack shit. BUT have gotten better thank to anti-depressant, Amitriptyline (25mg). Will try to keep updates weekly/bi-weekly.**

494,"Just wondering if anybody can give me some advice in regards to Zopiclone and Hydroxyzine. Hi, I'm 25 and based in England, I have struggled hugely with sleep since I was around 17 due to anxiety which went undiagnosed til I was 23 after I developed quite bad depression.

I was originally given 50mg Sertraline which eventually lead up to going up to 150mg a month ago and whilst this has helped a lot with my depression it's never helped at all with my anxiety and sleep issues.

Around a year into taking Sertraline I pushed my doctors to start prescribing me different medication along side my sertraline that works for either my anxiety or sleep. So far we've had 3 different doses of Amitriptyline, Propranolol, another medication that I actually cant remember the name of and finally Zopiclone.

Now my doctor never really gave me any information on how or when to take zopiclone and the box said 1-2 tablets on a night so the first night I tried 1 and nothing happened, I then had a night off before trying 2 the following night, 2 actually relaxed me a little but sleep didnt happen and if anything I actually ended up quite wavey and had a really fun night but obviously not what I wanted to happen at all. I then took another night off and decided to try 3 the following night and hey presto it fucking worked and I had a great sleep.

Fast forward 2 weeks and I run out of the Zopiclone as I was only given 1 strip. So today I rang my doctor, explained that propanalol wasnt helping so I no longer wanted to take that and then I explained to her how the Zopiclone was relaxing me if I had 2 but no sleep and was knocking me out perfectly if I had 3. I asked if I would be able to get some more and have 3 on a night and she was not happy about all saying that 7.5mg is the maximum dose and they weren't allowed to prescribe it as a dose with another pills worth. She then prescribed me 25mg Hydroxine and told me it was the max dose possible of that but I've googled it tonight and I can clearly see people are prescribed 50mg+

So basically what i need to know is, has anyone ever been prescribed more than 7.5mg per night of zopiclone? Or has anyone ever been prescribed it for daytime anti anxiety relief? Aaaaaaand should I expect anything from 25mg of hydroxide if I can put down 7.5mg of zopiclone without yawning.

I'm in my mid/late 30's and have struggled with mental health issues since I was a pre-teen. I've been diagnosed with MDD, as well as an anxiety disorder. I've tried many different medications with varying results. Some of them worked ok for a while, and most of them haven't worked.

I'm currently prescribed 150mg of amitriptyline at night as well as other medications that don't relate to mental health. I had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday the 14th, and asked him if he would be willing to prescribe loxapine, which is an atypical antipsychotic (which is basically one step below clozapine - which is a REMS drug and only used as a very last resort).

I took my first dose (10mg)  of loxapine last night at around 9:15pm, I was out cold before midnight, and woke up at 10:45 this morning. I feel refreshed, I feel calm and not agitated, my mood isn't sour.

This single pill gave me the best sleep I've had in more than 6 months. 

All the best to everyone, I hope you're able to take something away from this post. The nice thing about loxapine is that it's not a benzo, and doesn't have any of the addiction or dependence issues.",Amitriptyline
498,"i just literally cannot fall asleep.... hi, i’m 24, i have severe GAD and panic disorder. i’ve been on and off treatment for about 4 years and consistently on treatment now for 3 years! and along with allll of that, i have bad insomnia. with all the anxiety in the world weighing on my shoulders. i used to take over the counter sleeping pills and they worked for a couple years but made my life somehow worse. and then finally I changed my doctor and she prescribed me amitriptyline, and that worked like a charm. but today, i went to see her and take my refill but instead i got a surprise....there was another doctor with her, that later got introduced as my new doctor. which, of course, I didn’t like. I don’t like changes. 
this new doctor was insistent on me being too young to be taking amitriptyline 25 mg. and that she doesn’t want me to be forever on this medication because of my age, and that i have to find another way to sleep other than taking it. i was so shocked I couldn’t gather my thoughts. this new doctor is supposed to be more educated on psychology but she sounded like she doesn’t know the first thing about anxiety and sleeping disorders. she literally said “i know falling asleep can be hard sometimes” 
i’m like???? CAN BE HARD SOMETIMES????? 
b*tch i have not been able to sleep at all without help, for years!!!! I tried depriving myself from sleep and THAT didn’t even work. she was like “try sleep hygiene” 
HUH

500,"Cannabis or Amitriptyline? hello fellow insomniacs

so I've been in a month-long phase of chronic migraine and insomnia. Pain so bad that I can't sleep but sleeps so bad (/non-existent) that the migraine persists. 

Finally got in to see the doc and of course, medication was prescribed. Almotriptan for in the moment pain (which is wonderous) and a low dose (10mg) of Elavil (amitriptyline hydrochloride) for migraine prevention and assistance with sleep.  To take regularly. 

So Cannabis has helped me a great deal with pain, but of course, it doesn't have an incredibly long-lasting effect and I have to keep dosing etc. I haven't quite find these ""knockout"" strains that people keep talking about, or they just don't work for me (but please if you have recs. lemme know). 

I'm very much concerned about Elavil in the sense that it is also a tricyclic antidepressant and I've worked really hard to stay off of those types of drugs so it feels weird to be prescribed that (and also having your doctor not tell you that it was an anti-depressant as well... that was weird).

TL:DR? 

\- have you tried elavil what's your experience

\-what are your ""knockout"" cannabis strains (also preferred method of consumption for long lasting effects)

507,"Sleep deprivation induced hallucinations Hello, sorry this is so long, this is my first post here after discovering this sub, I have suffered from insomnia for around 20 years. 

This is incredibly embarrassing and distressing for me to talk about, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have seen a couple of articles online where people have had hallucinations after lack of sleep, but they seemed to be aware that they were hallucinating, and I truly, truly believed what I was seeing was real  :(

3 days ago I had been awake for 72 hours. I was convinced that there were fish swimming out from under my floor, and that there was a snake in a plastic bag in my living room. I actually took a video on my phone of this and sent it to a friend and my mother - just thinking about this makes me cringe. I actually called the police to get rid of the snake because I was so terrified, they came out and obviously no snake. I assumed it had moved elsewhere in my apartment. 

The police asked me about my mental health and then left. They then had apparently called paramedics, who checked me over and asked me the mental health screening questions like the date, year, who the prime minister is etc. I was convinced at that point that the snake was on one of the sofas in my living room, and after they left I could see it clearly - a HUGE snake, if I made a noise it would react, it was slowly opening and closing its mouth...I wasn't scared by this but wouldn't go near it. I even took more photos. I also called the RSPCA to come and get it. They did attend and as soon as they did I couldn't see the snake anymore. They searched my place and found nothing, looked at the photos and said they were not convinced that it was a snake. I was still COMPLETELY convinced at this stage, about 12 hours after I first 'saw' it.

In the meantime, my friend was incredibly worried about me and the texts I was sending her telling her about the snake. I want to smack myself in the face thinking about this now! As I work with her, she spoke with my HR contact and they had a conference call with me, concerned about my mental state. They asked permission to speak with my brother (my next of kin, my parents live abroad). My brother came over after work and searched my place again and told me that he fully believed that I was hallucinating. He told me that he had experienced it too after going several days without sleep. I still insisted it was real. My brother also insisted that I eat something as I'd gone a couple of days without food - I'm severely disabled and can't cook meals when I'm having bad days so have been eating only once a day for a while as I have to depend on meal delivery services. 

That evening I was really scared, believing that there was a snake somewhere in my home. I set up barriers of plastic bags around so I'd hear the snake moving around. Thankfully I fell asleep with the help of some sleeping pills (far too many actually- 350mg diphenhydramine, some clonazepam and mirtazapine). The next day I knew that I'd been hallucinating. I felt so so upset, embarrassed, horrified that so many people were witness to my psychosis episode. 

The paramedics had spoken to my doctor, who is incredibly good and familiar with my problems with insomnia as well as my complex medical history. She is part time though so told them to instruct me to get an emergency telephone consultation as soon as possible. I spoke to a doctor I had never seen before late the day after the hallucinations. He was absolutely horrible, was somehow convinced that I was calling to obtain Tramadol, when in fact I'd been trying to explain my recent medical history since he was unfamiliar with my case. I've been on painkillers long term for a severe back injury. He shouted at me, wouldn't let me speak, and at the end of the call told me he was going to prescribe me Amitryptaline with no explanation. I was very distressed throughout the call and for the rest of the evening in floods of tears. 

Thankfully the next day a GP I've had treatment under before called me and was very kind, she spent about 40mins discussing treatment options (the first call lasted just over 5 minutes). She had obviously read my medical records and hospital correspondence, MRI results etc. She decided that the best option for me is to begin treatment with fentanyl transdermal patches to cope with the chronic pain which contributes to my insomnia. She also explained the Amitriptyline and how it would help, and increased the amount of mirtazapine I take. We also discussed other measures that will possibly help as zopiclone doesn't work for me anymore. 

So, I'm hoping that things will improve,  but I'm still terrified of the hallucinations happening again, and still very tearful and embarrassed about what happened. Last night I began the Amitriptyline and got about 3 hours of sleep. On Monday I begin the fentanyl, and I am both glad that my pain is being taken seriously and apprehensive about taking such a strong painkiller. My brother is coming over today to help with some housework and have lunch with me, so I'm looking forward to having him to speak to. I'd really like to know how common this is though, or if my brain is completely screwed up...I'm so scared of this happening again, it was absolutely real to me, now I can't help but wonder if I can really trust anything that I see!",Amitriptyline
508,Amitriptyline wasn’t working Just went to the doctor again since Amitriptyline wasn’t doing a thing for me. I was just prescribed 5mg Ambien. I didn’t want to take anything too crazy but I need sleep. Is Ambien safe for insomnia?,Amitriptyline
509,"Anxiety or Sleep Apnea? Hello,

I have a situation that I'm not sure what the problem is. So I can usually fall asleep pretty quickly (with 30 mins) but then around the 5-6 hour mark I usually wake up. Then go back to sleep and then wake up like an hour later, then maybe fall asleep and wake up like half an hour later. You get the gist. 

When I wake up I usually have some sort of thoughts running in my head almost has if i had been dreaming them or thinking about them when I woke up. It's kinda trippy. This made me think that oh I have anxiety issues and its making it hard for my brain to turn off. I have taken amitriptyline in the past which is  a TCA that helps with anxiety and i have been able to sleep better (eg continuous for 7 hours) but it makes me super groggy. I also don't have anxiety in the day to day, like I get anxious but I'm able to control without taking pills. 

On the other hand sometimes when I wake up during my sleep I have to pee which I find weird and after looking up online I found it can be indicative of sleep apnea. Although I always thought in sleep apnea you dont even realize that you're awake bc when I wake up after 5-6 hours of sleep i am conscious. 

And falling back to sleep has its own difficulties so I just wanted to ask if anyone experienced something similar to me or has some insight. Is my problem to get a breathing device for sleep apena or is it more related to anxiety.",Amitriptyline

511,"Ambien Withdrawal I know this seems like an odd place to call myself an addict, but I need help. I have been an insomniac since I was little. My parents gave me melatonin, then melatonin + Benadryl, then melatonin + Benadryl + valerian root, etc and so on until I hit 18 and my doctor prescribed me Ambien 10 mg. It is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me. The problem came when I had the Gastric Sleeve. Suddenly I wasn't just using Ambien to sleep. It became a need and 10 mg wasn't enough. I talked my bf into getting a 10 mg script and I started to take 20 mg a night. That was fine until I found out last December that my doctor will not prescribe Ambien anymore until I have tried other things. I've tried trazodone (got bad migraines), doxepin (gave me almost seizure like jerks), amitriptyline (migraine again), lunesta (starting vomiting an hour after taking it), Klonopin (does absolutely nothing), Xanax (once again... Nothing), nortriptyline (migraines), hydroxyzine (does nothing), weed (I get severely paranoid and have crying fits) and a combination of the above mentioned. During this time, my bf has been getting his Ambien and only giving it to me when I just can't take anymore lack of sleep 1-2 x a week. He found out today that his doctor will not prescribe anything else until he tries other avenues. Do you guys have any recommendations for getting myself off of Ambien?

- Vivid Nightmares
- Irritability

519,"Antidepressants work, but make me a slave to sleep. I found myself writing paragraphs explaining my entire history with insomnia earlier, but as it continued to go on and on, I realized what I really wanted to do was just express my frustration that the ONLY cure to ever really work for my insomnia, antidepressants, specifically trazodone and   Amitriptyline and to a lesser effect Zoloft, just turn me into an absolute zombie, utterly dependent on getting at least 9 hours of sleep to stay awake during the day. I remember when I tried trazodone for the first time, within days the daytime sleepiness had built to where after getting ""only"" 6 hours of sleep found myself being unable to stay awake during class, went out to my car and slept through the next class until my test later.  When I realized I felt less emotion and affection for my fiancee at the time I stopped taking it. Amitriptyline was even worse, after sleeping 9 and a half hours and falling asleep during work I took an early lunch break and found myself being pulled over after fighting the urge to fall asleep on the drive back to work.  It completely overwhelmed any effect my prescribed adderall might have had to where I once took one after waking up only to fall back to sleep for another 3 hours.  I can stop taking the adderall, I can cut out all caffeine, but my sleep doesn't improve, I've taken ambien only for the highest prescribed dose to stop working after a couple days, I stopped drinking every night in an attempt to get the minimum few hours I needed to function and through numerous other ways managed to improve my sleep enough so I have hope now, but when it strikes, nothing else can truly stop it. 

When the insomnia gets bad enough for desperation to set in, it still sometimes find myself telling myself yet again that the exhaustion they make me feel can't possibly be as bad as the sleep deprivation I was facing and yet it always is. While I'm sure some people envy that I have any ""cure"" at all, or may have such severe insomnia that the way those medications effect me would still be preferably, for me, they're still not solution at all, and it is unbelievably frustrating sometimes.",Amitriptyline

524,"Amitriptyline nightmares? Hey everyone. So here's some quick background on my history with insomnia before I get to the issue at hand. I've had insomnia for years. Some nights it's worse than others. When I was in college, I had a prescription for Trazodone followed by a prescription for Restoril. Trazodone would knock me out for 10-13 hours at a time and leave me with a hangover. Restoril worked alright, but it's habit-forming (I'm trying to avoid that). 

Recently, I moved in with a bunch of my friends and found that I get awoken at night very easily. Any time somebody opens a door, the draft causes my door to shake, which, in turn, wakes me up. So, essentially, if I go to bed early and my roommates stay up after I go to bed, I'm bound to be woken up *at least* once. That's assuming nobody leaves their room to go to the bathroom or anything else.

My doctor recently prescribed me some amitriptyline (10mg). It works pretty well! I usually fall asleep within 10-30 minutes and don't wake up in the middle of the night nearly as much (though I still do sometimes). However, every night I've taken it I've had extremely vivid dreams and nightmares. I had a dream last night that I got into a huge fight with my parents over nothing and my dad pulled a gun on me. It felt real, and I woke up really distressed. The night before that, I had a dream I was being chased by a mangled corpse through a space station and then had my arm chopped off... And I could feel the pain!

Once I'm asleep in normally fine until my alarm goes off, it's getting to sleep that's the problem. I have tried meditation, exercising until exhaustion, total blocking of all light and sound, not being in my room at all unless to sleep and yet nothing had helped. I have been prescribed propranolol, and when that didn't work, amitriptyline about 2 months ago now. This did also not work. The only two things to have actually helped have been codeine and marijuana. Marijuana is illegal where I am, expensive, and started making me paranoid and anxious every time so that is not an option. Codeine is an addictive opioid so that is also not really an option.

I'm wondering what medications others have had that have worked for them in similar situations? With my new very physical job, not sleeping is becoming a real issue and this constant 0-4 hours of sleep every night is clearly no longer sufficient for my body.

unwilling to prescribes me zolpidem, they tell me I'm too young (I will turn 22 next month) but it doesn't make sense because first time I went to a psychiatrist I was 15 and he gave me clonazepam.

532,"I’m at a loss. So I’ve been having troubles falling asleep due to my anxiety. Sometimes I’ll be completely exhausted during the day but once it comes to laying down my heart rate goes from Resting at 64-70 to 90-100 and I’m so anxious I can’t fall asleep. 

I’ve been going to therapy for over a year for my anxiety and panic attacks and it’s not really working for me. I exercise all the time. I’ve been meditating, I never nap, I have my phone and computer set to night move an hour and a half before bed and even then I try to avoid them. 

I’ve tried reading before bed. I’ve tried 5mg melatonin, sleeping medication, and magnesium. I’ve also tried my prescription Xanax.

I went to the doctor and she gave me amitriptyline which first night it worked like a charm but it hasn’t worked since. I’ll use all of this in combination with melatonin then maybe Xanax if the heart palpitations goes over 100 and I’m still taking hours to fall asleep and make myself wake up 7am every morning and I’m just exhausted all day. 

Honestly I’m at a loss. I feel like when I wake up at 7 naturally I want to sleep in later. They say it’s good to have a set wake up time and it’ll help fall asleep but so far that’s not helping at all seeing as I’m exhausted all day up until the point where I try to fall asleep at night. Should I even continue with the amitriptyline? I have a follow up appointment next week.",Amitriptyline
533,"warning about Amitriptyline I have pretty severe maintenance insomnia, for which my doctor prescribed an antidepressant called Amitriptyline. He assured me, ""The dosage will be so low that it won't actually function as an antidepressant, or produce any side effects.""

Your experience with this drug may differ from mine, but here's what one 25mg pill did to me:

* I woke up that night only once, which is much less than normal. (This is the only good bullet on this list.)
* I didn't, and couldn't, wake up until 2 hours later than normal. (It's a very good thing I had the foresight not to try this medicine before a work day.)
* Upon waking up, I felt like I could barely move.
* This feeling continued throughout the day. I felt like a zombie, or like the way they describe Thorazine. Even sitting upright felt difficult. Thinking was not easy. I ended up just zoning out for long stretches of time, because I couldn't do or enjoy many other activities.
* It got better, but VERY gradually. I wasn't able to walk around comfortably until 6pm.
* It produced some of the side effects mentioned in the accompanying literature, most notably suicidal thoughts. I was sitting on the balcony of a high rise building (the sun felt kind of nice), and I kept thinking ""jump off."" And I'd say NO I'm not going to jump off! And I'd think ""just climb up the rail and see how it feels"" and I'd say NO I'm not going to climb up the rail!!! And so on. Knowing that invasive thoughts were caused by the medicine helped me to resist them, as did my extreme lethargy, but it was honestly scary. (Side note: feeling like a near-paralyzed zombie was not among the very long list of possible side effects.)
* My sleep that following night, for which I wisely decided not to take a second pill, was much worse than normal. And it remained worse than normal for a good week or two, after which it finally settled back to its normal rate of not very good.

So: I won't say ""don't take Amitriptyline under any circumstances""—just be aware that it might do more than you want it to, while simultaneously not fixing the issue at hand.

At the very least, consider starting with half a pill.",Amitriptyline

538,"Don't have an imsomnia, having sleep trouble and have a few questions - amitriptyline 10mg Hi, to preface this i'm a young healthy male in third year at university. I eat well, workout and have a good social life. My sleep has been bothering me since I can remember, I can't remember the last time I fell asleep and woke up well rested, it must be over a decade ago. No matter what time I wake up in the morning I fall straight back asleep, I don't really wake up I turn off my alarm half asleep and go back to bed, this process can repeat for hours. 

For example, last night I got in bed at 1:30am and read a book, my alarm was set for 11:15 (I had class at 12:00), I woke up at 14:00 feeling tired, I can't remember my main alarm going off - which is extremely loud and my phone alarms don't even stir me. I'm a very deep sleeper and feel tired most of the time.

The same process repeats itself  a lot and I usually wake up in the afternoon.

In first year at university one of my friends gave me a 'sleeping tablet' (amitriptyline 10mg) the following few days/week after taking this was one of the best I can remember. I can remember feeling tired at 11pm and waking up naturally without an alarm at 7am which doesn't sound like a lot but made me so happy, I also didn't feel tired lying in bed. Upon waking now if I don't get out of bed immediately I fall back asleep but back then I lay in bed on my laptop without being tired. This lasted for a few days and I felt so energetic and ready to take on the day. 

I constantly think about those few days where I felt good and want to do something about it. I searched for sleep and amitriptyline which led me to this sub.

I think amitriptyline is also used for depression however I don't feel depressed, I know if I can get this sleep problem under control nothing will be holding me back.

I wanted to ask if anyone had a similar problem to me and how they solved it? 

Or if anyone has any comments to make i'd appreciate them.

Melatonin: 6/10. It’s prescription only in my country and very expensive. Loses its effectiveness but no side effects)

Imovane (Zopiclone): 7/10. Very effective and no hangover effects. But also extremely addictive and tolerance develops quickly. Persistent bad taste in mouth the next day is a horrible side effect too.

Benadryl (diphenhydramine): 6/10. Reasonably effective and cheap. Dry mouth side effects and hard to get in my country.

Phenergan (Promethazine): 7/10. More effective than Benadryl and better for anxiety as well. OTC in my country. Relatively cheap.

Temazepam: 7/10. Cheap and effective. Same as Imovane but cheaper in my country and no taste disturbances. Also addictive and tolerance develops quickly.

Elavil (Amitriptyline): 5/10. Very cheap but doesn’t always put me to sleep. Lots of side effects especially with long term use.

Remeron (Mirtazapine): 9/10. Has always been effective for me and is very cheap. Increased appetite and weight gain with long term use and can make you sleep 10+ hours. Didn’t give it a full 10/10 due to side effects.

But now the last few years, I've had depression, anxiety, and then PTSD and TMJ from jaw clenching at night. I never get restful sleep even with 8 hours, and waking up is incredibly difficult when I feel sick from not getting quality sleep and depression making me want to stay in bed. I often snooze alarms for hours and then finally get up around 9. In my snoozing periods with 10-15 min blocks of sleep ill have vivid dreams about me supposed to be at work. I don't have sleep apnea (tested negative twice) but I know I'm tossing and turning, and having interrupted sleep. I've had a septoplasty done twice but still don't really breathe through my nose as optimal as I'd like. Now always have back/neck pain too (shouldn't be this prevalent as a mid 20s male). I now have anxiety about sleep itself, and am constantly significantly late to work. 

&nbsp;

I take wellbutrin (and go to CBT) for depression (allowing me normal sexual function), but the constant vivid dreams happen, often about the PTSD event. At least my light dose klonopin mostly prevents them from being nightmares. I've tried melatonin to get my circadian rhythm back to 7am wake up, trazedone, amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine (for jaw), zquil, and probably more. I'm about to try some magnesium, maybe that will help. I also use a weighted blanket which seems like it may help a bit. Breathing strips don't seem to help, and I use a fan for white noise.

I'm waking up anywhere from 4-8 times a night. I go to sleep around the same time every night (10pm-6am). I try not to drink any liquids after 6pm or barely any. And I started taking amitriptyline. But nothing's helping. Does anyone have any experience with this?",Amitriptyline
555,"I'm pretty sure I have little to no circadian rhythm at all. There is virtually no routine to my sleep as far as I can tell. Most people apparently, will naturally feel tired at the same time each night, and wake up feeling reasonably normal at the same time each morning. I have no such urges at all. I go to bed feeling awake (95% of the time I go to bed because it's time that I did, not because I actually feel sleepy). I wake up feeling incredibly tired and it is such a huge struggle to get myself to wake up enough to get out of bed, that I can go through 10 alarms at 5 minutes apart, cancel them all in my sleep and then sleep for another 4 hours (feeling like utter shit afterwards for sleeping 12 hours).

On average it takes me 2 hours to fall asleep each night. Sometimes it'll only be half an hour, sometimes it'll be 4 hours. There have been times where I went to bed at 3am and will still be awake by 10am. I either give up at that point and get up, or stay in bed and end up sleeping until the evening. Sometimes I fall asleep at midnight and wake up 3 hours later, unable to go back to sleep until the next night.

I always feel tired and ill. Obviously I don't have a proper job. I did have a 9-5 job once, but I only lasted 3 months before they replaced me. Partly because I was so tired all the time that keeping myself from collapsing onto the floor or at my desk was a daily struggle (coffee did not help). I can't work properly when 50% of my day is spent trying not to drift off. The GP gave me a thyroid function test, but found it was normal.

My current job is not helpful at all. I work as a waiter for an agency and jobs can be at any random time. Last night I finished at 2am and was home by 3am. In a couple of days time I have a 10am to 4pm job. It's making me worse, but it's the only work I've managed to get.

Does anyone else find that their sleep patterns have no consistency at all? It's not just the struggling to fall asleep and keep sleep, but having absolutely no natural desire to sleep or wake up at the correct times. Did you find anything that helped? I know it's partially a matter of discipline, but I just can't gather enough willpower to overcome the overpowering urge to stay asleep when I need to wake up. I feel like what I imagine most people do after an hour of sleep, except that I've actually had 8. Also, I had quite a good routine with my 9-5 job. I slept within 30-60 minutes and got up at the same time each day. Somehow I felt much worse during my waking hours than when I have a bad routine. I never figured out what made me so, so tired at that time.

I've tried melatonin, Sleep As Android (sleep tracking and maths problems to turn off the alarm), I use f.lux and Twilight. Zopiclone is the only drug that has worked well for me, but sadly I can't take it every night (in fact the GP won't give me any more of it since they think I've had too much already). The GP won't give me a sleep study because they don't think I'll benefit from it. I sometimes use Amitriptyline now, but it makes me very groggy and doesn't wear off as well as Zopiclone (I think ultimately it makes the problem worse).

It is ruining my life and has been for a long time. I'm 26, 27 next month. Have horrible depression and little motivation and I know it's all interlinked. People are supposed to lose their bad sleeping patterns after becoming 20, but for me it has just gotten worse with age.

It had got to the point where I sleep mostly in the day and am awake most of the night, I never sleep longer than four hours at a time. If I try to make some structure it doesn't work, if I need to sleep I'll sleep, I even fell asleep standing up at work once, so trying to stay awake in the day won't work. 

Pills aren't much use (I've tried over the counter herbal sleeping pills, amitriptyline on prescription and extra strong codeine) they either take a random age to work for example I take one at the time you are supposed to then fall asleep heavily the next afternoon, either that or I sleep all night then most of the next day then wake up in the afternoon, so I won't sleep until the next morning or sleep straight way then wake right up at 4 in the morning.

560,"My short term “cure” for insomnia (long post) I had a trauma occur and have had insomnia for almost year. I know that insomnia has to be up there with the worst mental conditions. 

I had a bout of insomnia with no REM and no deep sleep for a month, I felt awake the whole time and it was the worst experience of my life. I felt like my natural ability to sleep was broken and circadian rhythm was damaged beyond repair. How did I eventually get sleep? (Besides micro sleep) Along with some other things I’ll mention, I finally found a medication combo that worked which is Mirtazapine (Remeron), Temazepam/Klonopin, Melatonin, a little weed (2 hours before bedtime) and a high dose of quality CBD. Now I take tolerance breaks from these meds and my sleep is a little shaky but the meds I use on my T break is Trazodone, CBD, Weed and Magnolia Bark. I’m hoping therapy will help me ween off the meds and switch to only natural remedies. We know the risk potential with Benzos so use them only when you absolutely need them, and if you get to that point, the pros outweigh the cons. But still don’t take them daily for long periods of time.

Retraining your circadian rhythm is a big factor if you’ve gone weeks without sleep. If your circadian rhythm was so out of wack like mine I suggest you get sunlight in the morning whenever you “wake up” and caffeine early in the morning, obviously not near bed time. It tells your body this is when you should wake up. Now before you lay down to go to sleep at night, stay up as long as you possibly can before your body starts to give in, aka sleep restriction therapy, and then add in the medication. Make sure your occupying your time with fun and mellow activities during this time and minimal blue light. If you suffer from OCD tendencies or negative thought patterns I highly recommend and OTC supplement NAC to take in the daytime. One of the biggest keys is to make sure to supplement with Creatine, Vitamin BCD, Fish Oil, Magnesium, Zinc, Fiber and a TON of water as your body gets depleted of these quicker during long bouts of insomnia especially Vit B, creatine and water. Try to be as healthy as possible to counteract the negative health effects from insomnia, exercise is crutial but don’t over do it. Get really nice earplugs and therapy can really help as well. A lot of people don’t understand insomnia so having a therapist to vent about it to is helpful.

I believe 98% of peoples insomnia stems from some form of trauma in their life, or just gradually built up depression, or both. One of the most important thing I mention is to remind yourself that your insomnia is caused by the trauma and is a normal reaction to it. No need to put blame on yourself, some things are out of our control. 

Other meds I’ve tried-

Seroquel- This is a god send for some and definitely makes you tired but it’s feel weird type of tired that keeps me up. 

Trazodone- Not terrible, it works sometimes but not when anxiety is high. 

Hydroxyzine- Worked a few times then stopped.

Ambien- Works when paired with benzo be careful with doses.

Magnesium/Melatonin/CBD/Theanine- Hopefully I’ll get to a point where these are all I need but not currently.

Phenibut/Gabapentin- GABA-B antagonists give me sort of energizing feel so didn’t work well the few times I tried it. Don’t use daily.

Kratom- Really good natural remedy for depression. Don’t use daily.

I want to try Magnolia Bark and Oleamide, I hear work well. I also need a consistent meditation routine.

562,"Learning I had a particular allergy effectively solved my sleep issues TL;DR: Allergic to beds, basically. Was so used to never being able to fall or stay asleep that it didn't occur to me my nose congestion and occasional difficulty breathing when I got into bed wasn't normal and unrelated, but in fact an allergic reaction to substances in beds themselves- either dust mites or common materials in mattresses/pillows. Began using allergen covers with allergy medication which effectively treated any symptoms. Definitely a factor in how anxious I'd feel trying to fall asleep as well, deep breathing and all that- I'd have the most intense looping/racing thoughts which wouldn't occur during the day.

---
--
(Sorry for click-bait title) Hope this is applicable to the sub or anyone who happens to experience something similar. Definitely a minority case with this though. Or maybe incredibly obvious to most, I dunno.

**Cause:**

- Allergies from dust mites or pillow/mattress materials, preventing me from breathing well enough.

Been suffering from chronic insomnia most of my life. A recurring issue was that I'd have difficulty breathing through my nose after getting into bed, sometimes to the point of having to rely on my mouth, and overall just having very mild asthma-like symptoms and anxious racing thoughts which became worse and eventually quite severe only as I got older. **I never had breathing issues or that intense of anxiety when I wasn't in bed** though, and somehow it never occurred to me this was not normal so figured I was simply a 'generic insomniac' and just lived with it not really thinking about it, never making a connection.

My symptoms and my sleep had been getting much worse over four-ish years, to a point where some beds I'd stay in from time to time (particularly ones laden with many layers and heavy duvets) would make me start wheezing and I'd feel nearly suffocated since my nose would close up entirely and my lungs become inflamed within ten minutes, but not in my own bed which was always very sparse comparatively.

After a couple times genuinely feeling like my lungs were on fire it made sense. 

Consulted my doctor who sort of plainly said I was 'allergic to beds.' (paraphrased)

Likely from [dust mites](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dust_mite_allergy) which are apparently on furniture/blankets everywhere all the time which I don't like to think about, or possibly the materials in pillows and/or mattresses. Either way it just wasn't significant enough to affect me outside of a bed, because it figures that more fabric and shit would carry more dust mites, and that only my face/breathing holes being in direct contact with the source would expose me enough to have a noticeable reaction. Skeptical it could have been that simple but he suggested:

**Solution:**

- Getting allergy covers for my mattress, pillows, duvet (The duvet I ultimately stopped using in favor of a heavy wool blanket) and sleeping with as few layers possible. 

- Using a fluticasone propionate spray (aka Flonase) daily if needed, and when sleeping in other beds or in the winter if I need another layer. (Not to be confused with Afrin or Benzedrex).*

He was correct. No more insomnia for the most part after three years now.

Anyways if anyone is stumped but notices they wake up mouth-breathing a lot or have other breathing trouble, could be a chance that allergens from your bed are a contributing factor.*

It takes me hours to fall asleep and even then I wake up multiple times and each night feels never ending. I have been prescribed 30mg mirtazapine which I have been taking for over 3 months. I am only 30 years old and feel hopeless. I don't feel like socializing with friends or family and tend to keep to myself because of this. Other than my sleep,  I feel fine but just want to go back to normal.

564,"A control thing? Wtf have I done to myself :( I lost it yesterday, sat down in the shower and cried. I’m exhausted, I’m scared, I’m frustrated. I had had a few messy hours of ambien sleep, I’m on week 4 of nightly mirtazapine (almost 2 weeks at the 30mg dosage). After this fall-apart bawling I laid back in bed with my cat because I felt *sleepy* not just exhausted. I skimmed though the next 2 hours, only vaguely aware of which Office episodes played - the closest thing to actual unmedicated sleep I’ve had in months. 

I’ve been having desperate, disturbing, and suicidal thoughts. I’m falling behind on my responsibilities. I’m terrified those dear to me will die. I love sleeping - always have. It’s the only escape from the terrible anxiety I struggle with, and now I can’t get to it. What have I done? How the hell do I fix this? The closer it gets to bedtime the less sleepy I get. I follow the protocol. I haven’t had any caffeine in weeks. I do meditations and stretches. I have a bedtime routine, but by the time I go to bed I’m wide awake. What really sucks is that I haven’t been able to nap either. 

If this is my psyche trying to maintain control, what do I do? Will the antidepressant really fix this? My physician and therapist continue asking me to be patient for the mirtazapine to kick in. Maybe I’m at a critical point this weekend because my emotions are a mess. I’m hesitant about reaching out to anyone when I feel this bad, because it’s embarrassing. Has anyone dealt with the “control” aspect of this? I’m obviously not deliberately having insomnia, but letting go is something I struggle with.

I started 7.5 mg mirtazapine a couple weeks ago and it already stopped working. Even 15 mg combined with lorazepam and melatonin does nothing. This was the only medication that didn't give  me side effects.

566,"Please Help! I'm desperate with acute insomnia This is my first post and I'm desperately seeking help for my insomnia that started two weeks ago.

I'm a very healthy person in my 50's and have always slept very well in my entire life. I fall asleep fast and normally have 8 hours of sleep every night. This suddenly changed about two weeks ago when I get a covid and quarantined in my room.

During these two weeks, I feel nausea and cough a lot. I could not sleep at all during the night. Given this is in the holiday season and we did not need to work,  I thought I would make up the sleep during the day,  the strange thing was I felt very tired but not sleepy, I could not sleep during the day either.

This kept dragging on for about 10 days and get me extremely frustrated.   I just could not fall asleep, day and night. I tried almost all the different over-the-counter medicine, none works for me. not only, the side effect often made the matter worse. 

Now, I'm already testing negative for a few days, I still have a hard time falling asleep. My doctor prefers not to use medicine and let my body gradually work it out. But right now the most important thing for me is to get some sleep first to be able to function as a human being. He ends up prescribing me  Remeron (Mirtazapine) 7.5 mg to start. For some reason, I did not help much and he let me try 15 mg. I did get some sleep now(a few hours), but I still felt I sleep very light and easy to wake up in the middle. 

I'm very desperate now.  How a healthy person can suddenly become like this? I feel my body doesn't know how to sleep or feel sleepy anymore.  I'm really feared this will get into chronic insomnia and I will suffer for the rest of my life.  

Does anybody has a similar experience, or has some knowledge to share?

Can I eventually recover from this acute insomnia again? 

Thank you so much. Anything will be appreciated.

I was very excited yesterday morning because I dreamed - first time I’ve remembered a weirdo jacked up dream in way over a month. I actually felt human for a few hours. I had forgotten how great it felt to wake up even a little refreshed instead of defeated… I got all the way to REM! 

I decided to just try to rest for a few hours instead of the Pass/Fail exam of sleeping I’ve been doing. Instead of guided meditations I found some sleep hypnosis things on YouTube. I’d listen to one, then acknowledge that I rested a bit, maybe get up and pee, get some water, pet the cat, choose another video. I did this starting at 8:30 and around 3-4a.m. started noticing that I was feeling more “floaty” and relaxed. I liked the affirmations that I was hearing. I started repeating a few from Nick Wright (just stumbled across him). At around 6:00, I took off my headphones and suddenly WOKE from a goofy vivid dream. It was shortly after 8. So, I finally fell asleep, even if for only two hours. I was so excited. I felt almost normal again yesterday, until I got tired, but still like there has been progress. I was kind of excited to try again last night. I hadn’t taken much either, and nothing after I went to bed.

I didn’t sleep last night. I didn’t even feel trance-like or drifts last night. Wtf? It’s like I was resisting the effort. 

Tomorrow will be 8 weeks since I got a decent night’s sleep. One week ago I got a new physician, she has me taking mirtazapine 15mg plus 10mg melatonin at the same time each night. I was doing this, albeit not as regimented, I’m not overly hopeful that in 2-4 weeks I’ll begin sleeping. I’ve also used unisom, Benadryl, trazodone, seroquel, tryptophan, even ambien/zolpidem. My brain has decided to rebel against everything. The ambien worked for 5 hours of crappy sleep - for the first week. Now i don’t fall asleep on any of it.

I don’t know why my brain is fighting sleep so bad. I’m exhausted. I love sleep. There is no joy in telling anyone I still didn’t sleep. Sleep has become unfamiliar. I’m having a very hard time being kind to myself. I don’t understand why I’m “overthrowing” everything. I’m so frustrated. This weekend I tried to accept that this is more than likely psychological.

I've struggled with insomnia my whole life, been off and on meds throughout the years, have an official diagnosis, but still am having problems.  This year my insomnia has become the worst it's ever been.  This has also been the most stressful year to date.  I've been sick since February and have been diagnosed with IBS, still getting it fully under control.  Realized I'm likely on the spectrum and am on a waitlist for testing.  Almost lost my condo and was forced to sell and come clean to everyone in my life about financial difficulties (since resolved through sale of the condo, even bought a house to live in).  My sleep disturbances have gotten significantly worse throughout all of this, and we're on medication 5 to try and get this under control.  So far I'm not happy with it.  


So far, we've tried Trazodone, Lunesta, Nortriptyline, Doxepin, and now we're on Remeron/Mirtazapine.  It's not helping me sleep at all.  I wake up feeling tired and unmotivated (GP just increased me from 15mg to 30mg on the Remeron to help with this), and even with my ADHD medications I'm starting to have issues concentrating at work again.  I have no motivation to do anything, I haven't been able to unpack boxes sitting in my garage for the last month even though they annoy me.    I sleep maybe 3-4 hours a night, I fall asleep around 4am and wake up at 6:30am and if I can fall back asleep I wake up around 9:30 - 10am.  I have immense trouble getting out of bed.  My GP is convinced this is all related to anxiety, and that with the right dosage of Remeron that this will all go away.  While my anxiety is less than it was it's still there.   I feel like a shell of the person I used to be.  I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything really other than apathy.   GP says I need to stick this out and since we've seen ""some improvement even if I can't see it"" and once my brain chemistry balances out I'll be better, but I just feel like I'm getting worse / am not myself.  At this point the only thing that's keeping me sane at night is dabs and watching Star Trek.   Is this normal for Remeron or do I need to request a new medication?

While I know many of you struggle with sleeping far less than me, and I sympathize with you all, that does not feel natural to me, during the day I move a lot and it is impacting me negatively. I wish to fix my light sleeping, and I am looking for advice.

\-----

I've ADHD and PTSD, this I am quite sensitive to noises. I live with my parents, our apartment is quite small and walls/doors don't isolate noise at all.

My mother goes to sleep at 1 o'clock, and I can't fall asleep while she's in her room and using the bathroom. After she has turned offe her light, stopped using the bathroom, the phone, etc... it takes me around half an hour to fall asleep, I think. My father wakes up around 6:30, he goes to the bathroom, hence waking me up. At this point I can stay in bed and chill, but I can't seem to fall asleep again. (Long story, but they do not sleep in the same room. Mine is between theirs, and close to the bathroom).

I am grateful to my parents for a number of reasons, and I realize it is my problem to fix, since the lack of sleep is starting to impact me very negatively. I tried to briefly discuss the problem with them, with no avail, and as I said I know it's my problem. They tried to be quieter for a while, and it honestly did not help much.

I have tried earbuds but they don't seem to cover the noise of people going to the bathroom, in a way they almost highlight those noises that are not background noises; headphones with active noise cancellation + app with sounds to sleep seems the best solution but after a while the headphones themselves disturb me. White noise machines don't seep to help as much, plus I do not want to disturb other people myself.

I hope my psychiatrist will prescribe me Mirtazapine again, since it seemed to help. The problem is that she is not keen on me being on it for months, since it might take one or two years before I can move out. And who is to say I won't find noisy neighbors?

A part of me worries that Lexapro messed up my brain and caused this chronic insomnia but I know how unlikely that is.  It’s just my anxiety talking.  

Was anyone else in my shoes with insomnia and anxiety BEFORE starting ssri.  Did it help?

Edit: Thank you all so much.  This has been so helpful and I’m not as scared now about trying something.  I’ve had no luck with changing my diet, sleep hygiene or taking supplements.  Gabapentin, Hydroxyzine and low dose Mirtazapine are life savers and have helped me sleep up to this point but they are not long term solutions for me.  I just want to be able to fall asleep again without drugs. I also don’t want to live with this anxiety and constant negative thinking.

I have nighttime awakenings that is one of the biggest contributing factors in my insomnia. For example, I take 30mg mirtazapine a night for sleep. 3 hours later, I wake up and am unable to fall back asleep. I miss out on literally more than half my sleep if I don’t take another mirtazapine (which takes about 2-3 hours to put me asleep). Regardless though, I am still not getting enough sleep, and sometimes, I don’t even fall back asleep if I take another one. My psychiatrist says that I shouldn’t be taking another mirtazapine for nighttime awakenings. Trouble is, if I don’t, I start hallucinating a lot of pain and other stuff.

597,"Sleeping again - Mirtazapine (Remeron) Hi all.

I was at my wit's end a couple of weeks ago; tossing and turning every night, overthinking until my head hurt, launching my pillow across the room in total frustration. It was a torrid time in my life which I'm sure I will experience again but for now, I am happy to say I am sleeping once again.

When I say I had insomnia, I mean I did not sleep a wink for several days in a row. It has taken a toll on work, my social life, and most importantly, my mental health. I found myself crying for no apparent reason as I couldn't cope with the anxiety caused by not sleeping. 

Insomnia is a vicious downward spiral as many of you well know. You don't sleep which makes you anxious and your anxiety means you cannot sleep. I didn't see a way out of this spiral until now but I seem to have come out the other side, although I hope I haven't spoken too soon.

I used to rely on sleeping pills (specifically Zopiclone) when I had bouts of insomnia previously, but this time even the highest dose permissible by my doctor would do nothing to quell my sleeplessness. I researched a lot about the relationship between your gut health and mental health as I'm certain my insomnia is related to an anxiety disorder of some description and therefore cut out gluten and sugar and stopped drinking alcohol. 

Previously I would drink around 25 units per week and binge drink on the weekend and the anxiety I had on a hangover was crippling at times. However, the biggest thing I am putting my recovery down to is a drug called Mirtazapine (or Remeron). Mirtazapine is an atypical antidepressant that is often used to treat depression and insomnia. You are supposed to take it 30 mins before bed because after 30 mins it makes you very drowsy. The best thing about it is that, unlike sleeping pills, you can actually achieve REM sleep which is incredibly important for our health and wellbeing.

What I do is take the medication and then read for 30 minutes until I become drowsy and then I seem to fall asleep relatively quickly.

Other than drowsiness, the other side effect is increased appetite. I am a pretty skinny individual anyway so this is a welcome side effect for me. It is also more difficult to get out of bed when taking this medication.

I am drinking alcohol again but not binge drinking. I will have maybe one or two pints instead of 10. I am also eating gluten and sugar again.

Please consult with a doctor before taking this medication.",Mirtazapine

Going to be doing a blood panel soon and will update if I find results.

I went to my psychiatrist again and something is not right me with me for sure. Worst thing that happened and this is the first time I experienced it in my life was the rewind and repetition after my alcoholic episode.   
I went to sleep and heard the conversation of everyone that night. My mind could not shut up, it was a scary moment. Basically, hearing voices of colleagues in your head what they were saying that night. Unreal experience.  
Psychiatrist believes that my insomnia is secondary and that I'll solve it once we find the right diagnosis which will follow with right medication. He gave trazodone, did nothing. Mirtazapine was working but with too many sides.

I think it might have been caused by the high dose inositol regimen ~18-24 grams per day that I had been taking over the summer to try and treat my PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction). I think the high dose of inositol messed something up, because my sleep has been wrecked, and I’m now an anxious and depressed mess most of the day.

Previously, I just lived with a constant low grade depression in the background, largely due to my PSSD.

Anywho, I’m at the point where I am desperate for sleep. Usually falling asleep isn’t the problem, but my sleep is very broken, and I’m usually wide awake by 4-4:30am and feel very wired.

I already take melatonin, the OTC antihistamines aren’t very helpful, I’ve tried hydroxyzine and low dose doxepin to no avail. Those latter two seemed to make things actually worse, as in made it impossible to fall asleep. Ambien is so so, but I don’t want to become dependent.

603,"Getting off 0.5mg of Ativan. Any suggestions? 

I’ve been taking 37.5 mg of trazodone since beginning of year for trouble sleeping which works semi okay, but end of may I got a concussion and developed post concussion syndrome with terrible anxiety, sleeplessness, depression and inability to cope. My doctor was reluctant to put me on a long term antidepressant so he said to just take Ativan as needed and gave me 90 pills. I began taking half a mg of it at bedtime with the trazodone and it helped ease my crying/anxiety and get some rest although it wasn’t always super great. My doctor told me it was fine to continue taking it daily. Long story short my post concussion syndrome did not get better and 4 months later I kept having panic and meltdowns and couldn’t take it anymore. So I saw a neuropsychiatrist who told me to get off the Ativan because it can inhibit cognitive repair and replace it with zopiclone right away (otherwise I’ll get withdrawal)until he starts me on an antidepressant Mirtazapine ( can’t start yet since he has to notify my doctor etc), after which point the goal is to stop having anxiety and stop taking sleeping pills as he thinks my anxiety is the cause of my insomnia. This all freaks me out as I’m super worried to go from one addiction to the next. I had no idea I would get withdrawal symptoms from half a mg of Ativan, it didn’t even work all that amazingly for sleep. So a part of me just wants to wean off of it stay on the trazodone at bedtime and wait for the antidepressant to begin in 2 weeks.

I can’t ask this guy again because that appointment was only one consultation session then he passes me back to my family doctor (who is kind of useless).",Mirtazapine
604,"Long-term sleep problems and sleep medications Hello, besides suffering from anxiety and depression, I have been also struggling with sleep problems for a very long time.  Currently, **I need to take 7.5mg of zolpidem with 25mg of promethazine (an antihistamine drug) every night, to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep.** I also take valerian (800mg), melatonin (6mg), CBN oil every night, however, they work more or less like a placebo in my case.

The combination of zolpidem with promethazine usually works, but not always. And sometimes, even after 8 hours of sleep, I feel like I wasn't sleeping at all! In the morning, I feel sleepy, cold, tired, exhausted,  irritated, and my eyes are tired (with pressure like feeling) .... but I can't go back to sleep, or take a nap(during the day), I won't fall asleep even when I am exhausted! Other days it's more or less okay.

**Can you please help me to figure out, if those fatigue and exhaustion effects are associated with zolpidem or promethazine? Is there even a possibility that melatonin could be the cause?** 

It won't happen every night, but at least once or twice per week (it's unpredictable). Usually, when I keep waking up several times in the morning, I know for sure I will be exhausted for the rest of the day (even If I slept for 9 hours in total on that night).

In the past, my psychiatrist gave me a prescription for quetiapine 12.5 -25mg for sleep support (PRN use). I took it twice and I didn't like it at all! It made me feel groggy, drowsy, and confused for the whole next day. Trazodone didn't help with sleep, and it gave me the next-day side effects. Mirtazapine knocked me out, but I slept for 12 hours straight and I gained a lot of weight on this medication (even while I was on the lowest/starting dosage).

I am trying to get off zolpidem or at least reduce the dosage to a half. I know it's not healthy at all, especially taking it every night. In the past, my sleep problems were even worse, so I am glad that nowadays I am able to get some sleep for most of the days, even with the help of zolpidem.

607,"2.5 years of severe insomnia and I am better! This is how I did it. Hi all

I want to share with you all how I managed to get out of the horrendous hole of insomnia, because if I can do it anyone can. Honestly!!

Back story - I never had issues sleeping but then a stressful job triggered insomnia. It got so bad that I was on 30mg a day of mirtazapine and this would do absolutely nothing even tho it’s enough to knock out a horse. I would lie there having panic attacks, heart racing and unable to switch off my mind for hours every night. I was at times suicidal and seriously contemplated ending it all as I just couldn’t take another night of that living hell. I ended up messing with more prescription meds, which screwed my already fragile mind up even more. I was basically a living zombie just getting by. I was prescribed zopiclone and that wouldn’t even knock me out. Basically, it was bad… really bad.

I hit a turning point when a psychiatrist put me on a medication that was basically making me high. It turns out it’s highly addictive and most people end up on heavy doses and addicted for life, it has a really high street value. Why they thought it would be a good idea to put someone so mentally fragile on a drug like this, I have no idea. It was only when I saw a doctor about a very sore neck and told him what meds I was taking, that he almost had a meltdown on terrible thisdrug was and that I should come off it right away (he was shocked I had been prescribed this). That was a real wake up call that I have to try a different approach. 

I bought a book called ‘The Sleep Solution’ - please read it. It’s brilliant! I started taking yoga classes. I followed a piece of the book’s advice and implemented the same sleep schedule every day, even at weekends, so without fail I get up at 7am even if I didn’t get to sleep until late. In tandem I found a Hynotherapist. We did this form of hypnotherapy called RTT where you have an intense 2 hour session and find the root cause of the issue. They then make a recording just for you, and you listen to it every day for a month. 

After week one I felt able to try and sleep without medication. After week 4 I started not using recordings to sleep and just listening during the day. I never thought I would be able to be in bed with my thoughts and drop off. But now 3 months later, I drop off within 15 minutes and don’t use any medication! I never ever thought I would be able to do this again and it’s honestly changed my life. I finally feel like myself again… I can focus on my work, I’m a good friend and partner. I’m writing this because I totally empathise with anyone in that dark place and not seeing a way out. If I can help anyone with this advice it will make me so happy that I have shared. I highly recommend giving this mindful approach a go and hypnotherapy if you can. 

On a final note - I didn’t realise that these medications to sleep actually disrupt your hormone cycle that makes you sleepy at night. Therefore you become dependent on them to feel sleet which further perpetuates the problem. I took about 6 weeks to get to a point where I felt naturally sleepy and can fall asleep in 15 mins rather than over an hour, but I did it. 

Good luck and let me know if any of this helps you 🙏🏻",Mirtazapine

There is no words I can use to explain how this feels like. The headaches, pressure, suicidal thoughts, sleep anxiety, everything has gone after 3 days of sleeping well.

Also, I tested my self going to bed at various times each day from \[12-4 am\] and every-time I will fall asleep within 20min. on avg.Hopefully this trend continues, will post my fitbit results after a month.

You might ask, what have I done? I quit my old job for good, returned to my home country and at first it got worst before it got better.

The insomnia with Nardil has been severe. When I started Nardil I was already on Seroquel and was getting maybe 5 hours sleep, which I could handle. However more recently (couple of months ago) I came off Seroquel because I had put on weight and blamed Seroquel rather than my own gluttony and because the same dose was now giving me 3 hours sleep a night.

Came off Seroquel and had total insomnia for a few days. I was determined not to take any sleep meds just because the insomnia coming off Seroquel was so terrible, it wasn't something I wanted to go through more than once with another med. I thought if I could just get through it then natural sleep couldn't be much worse than 3 hours a night.

I was wrong. Even a month after coming off Seroquel I was having many nights of zero sleep and the other nights would be one or two hours. There were days I would fall asleep in the afternoon though. I also gained MORE weight because i was awake all night and not eating after dinner is easy enough if you're going to sleep at midnight and sleeping 8 hours but not so easy when you're awake all night.

I've tried Benzos, Z-drugs (both zopiclone and just last night 10mg zolpidem), DPH, Melatonin and all kinds of OTC supplements. My doc won't prescribe Trazodone because he's concerned about serotonin toxicity (there are articles disputing that but he still won't prescribe). Mirtazapine never helped me for sleep anyway and again, there's a 'serious' interaction possibility. Some of these drugs would help me get to sleep but I'd wake up after a couple of hours max. 

Seroquel - now I seem to need significantly more than the 25mg I was taking previously. In spite of all the 'less is more' when it comes to sleep stuff, that isn't true in my case. 300mg knocks me unconscious for 12 hours. Right now I'm just trying to find the right dose and guess it's going to be somewhere around 100mg. I know lots of people take that much and more. Still, I'm worried about becoming tolerant to its effects.

I should say I exercise 6 days a week, practice good sleep hygiene and am not stressed out or anything (I'm starting to become stressed about the lack of sleep but if I take the right drug I can fall asleep, i just can't stay asleep so I have the sleep maintenance type insomnia).

I could come off Nardil. It certainly triggered this (I have a medical history which means I'm always going to have to get up several times a night no matter what - will spare you the details - but I could always go right back to sleep) but I have two concerns with that: (i) that the insomnia now has a life of its own and coming off Nardil won't help; (ii) that unmedicated the depression is completely unmanageable and the most realistic option in terms of a med that may help is Parnate, which has an even worse profile for insomnia than Nardil does. 

I feel sort of scared that I'm down to ONE drug that can help me sleep. I had hoped to cycle meds. I feel that something like Ambien may work but I'd have to take more than 10mg which is the max prescribed dose. Possibly above 10mg isn't helpful for sleep anyway, you just end up doing a bunch of crazy stuff. 

I guess my only choice is to stick with the Seroquel and take whatever dose works. I just wondered if anybody else had any suggestions at all. I have talked with my doc but he hasn't really been helpful with this. He actually suggested CBT with a pal of his (referral fees, yay!) but I kind of feel that, for insomnia caused by a medication (Nardil) that's a bit like giving somebody meth then trying to get them to sleep using cognitive behavioural therapy. Of course it won't work because the drug causing the insomnia is massively overpowered compared to the benefit of any kind of therapy. I'm not saying Nardil is meth but there do seem to be some meth users that get better natural sleep than I do.   


TLDR: On an antidepressant where naturally I either don't sleep or sleep 1-2 hours a night. Tried pretty much everything to sleep that isn't contraindicated with Nardil. Only Seroquel works but at much higher doses than the 'typical' 25mg. Feel panicked that if Seroquel stops working or I get tolerant then I'm completely screwed. Also worried about long term Seroquel side effects (in particular tardive dyskinesia and akathisia). I'm probably just fucked but would appreciate any advice that doesn't involve lavender tea or warm baths, etc.",Mirtazapine
623,"At my wits’ end Hello fellow insomniacs.

I’m hoping to find someone with any guidance to my predicament.

All the posts I see here are filled with people who seem to be troubled with insomnia caused by racing / uncontrollable thoughts.

I seem to be one of the few affected by “physical” insomnia. 
What I mean by this is that when I go to bed, I am exhausted, and 3-4 out of 5 nights I fall asleep just fine, but, like clockwork I wake up at 1-2am (I go to bed around 10) and cannot for the life of me fall asleep again. 
When I wake up, I feel physically stressed - heart is racing/pounding, cortisol elevated… 

I stay awake until 7am when I wake up, tossing an turning, in a dream like state.

Ive tried melatonin, magnesium, prescription drugs (zopiclone, mirtazapine), ashwaganda, vitamin D, ginko, CBD, weed…

Ive tried morning exercise, saunas, healthy lifestyle in general…

Nothing works. Nothing.

And when I am laying in bed, whether falling alseep when I go to bed or after waking up at 1am, I am thoughtless, and mentally calm. Doctors are not helpful and I have tried everything I can think of. 
Heck, I’ve even tried medicating with benzodiazepines and they seem to work somewhat but at ungodly doses. 

Exercise and sauna, no matter what time of day, seems to make the problem worse.

This has been going on for the past 3-4 months, and, working a mentally demanding 9-5, I am feeling exhausted, defeated, and completely desperate for help. 

Is there anyone out there who has this non psychological insomnia?

I meditate regularly and have developed a very good control on my thoughts and mind. Despite this, my suffering persists..

Any input or help would be tremendously valuable.",Mirtazapine
624,"For those who have gotten better sleep from trazodone… Did the next day hangover go away eventually? If so, how long did it take? It’s really helping me stay asleep at night (doesn’t put me to sleep though), but I am tired during the day. 

That said, it’s a bit complicated for me to know where the tiredness is coming from. I’m narcoleptic, so that causes daytime sleepiness. Plus, I get fatigue from depression sometimes. I really want to keep going because studies show that it increases slow wave sleep (which I don’t get because of the narcolepsy). Mirtazapine (sp?) is another that is said to do that - if anyone uses that.

Thanks!",Mirtazapine
625,"Haven't slept for days. Today I just got so frustrated and irritable I took 100mg of Valium, 50mg of diphenhydramine, 25mg of doxylamine succinate and took a few shots a few hours ago. ... and I don't even feel tired. This shit is ridiculous. 

I've been prescribed seroquel mirtazapine and one other thing that I can't remember the name of, and they worked for a few days but then I grew tolerant, and I can't tolerate the weight gain. 

I don't know what to do sorry, just venting. 

P. S. 100mg of Valium alone would
probably have most people passed out for days, but for some reason it hardly affects me. Any other benzo and I'd be fast asleep right now. I feel like if anything it makes it harder for me to sleep, which makes no sense since it's a CNS depressant and potent muscle relaxer, but it really does feel like that, it's like I'm immune to it. I feel like I'm going to have to go back to strong RC benzos that knock you on your ass (flualprazolam is amazing for falling asleep), but l I really don't want to get into that again.",Mirtazapine

627,"Amitriptyline and mirtazapine Have been suffering from insomnia for past 6 weeks. I can usually fall asleep but after some vivid dreams for a couple of hours (if that), I wake up around 2-3am and can’t go back to sleep anymore at all.

I was put on amitriptyline (taking half of 25mg) and given zopiclone 3.75mg. The latter works for an additional 2-3 hours then I still wake up and don’t feel rested.

I am now very worried about building tolerance to z and wondered, after reading, whether it is sensible to rotate zopiclone with a very low dose of mirtazapine? (Couple of weeks each). Or do they do the same thing?

Also would it be safe to take a low dose of amitriptyline with a low dose of mirtazapine at all or would they interfere/augment each other in some way?
Also asking my doc but very difficult to get hold of him.

628,"Sleeping too much on mirtazapine. I’m on 15mg of mirtazapine and it’s shifted me from getting 2 hours of sleep a night to getting 12-14. At first, this seemed like a miracle and I thought my body was just catching up on sleep, but it’s been a month and I regularly wake up 12-14 hours after going to sleep. 

I tried setting an alarm for about eight hours after going to bed, but I physically couldn’t wake up and had horrible neck pain, so I went back to sleep. I tried again about a week after that, and noticed that despite having slept well for weeks, my eye bags were extremely noticeable just because I cut my 12 hours short one night. 

If I go on 7.5 mg it doesn’t do anything to help me sleep, and if I’m off the medication, my anxiety and sleep get horrible.

634,"Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety and tons of drugs Hello, I have a close friend in another country who needs some help that he’s not getting at home.  His medical problems started about seven years ago with insomnia which snowballed into myriad other afflictions, many of them side-effects of the medications: depression, anxiety, muscle pain/weakness, persistent nausea/vomiting, total lack of appetite, ED and suicidal ideation.  He and his doctors have tried an astonishing array of drugs (detailed below) but have made no progress in treating his insomnia and the other problems reduce his quality of life to near-zero.  To complicate things further, an unfortunate family situation routinely serves to make things worse.

&#x200B;

I’m posting here today because we’re hoping to find: 

\- medical professionals who don’t believe that the answer is “more drugs”

\- other individuals struggling, recovering or recovered from similar circumstances

\- recommended courses of action

\- facilities or support organizations with relevant expertise 

&#x200B;

As his friend, I believe that his doctors at home (in a country with public healthcare) have neither the resources nor the incentives to make him better, and so their efforts to medicate him are more about stabilization than recovery.  In other words, I believe that his doctors have basically given up.  I will not.  We eagerly welcome anything positive that this community has to offer.  Thank you.

635,"Really struggling Hi, everyone. 
I’ve been dealing with insomnia for about 6 years now. Tried prescriptions like trazadone, mirtazapine, clonidine. I have also various supplements (all similar to previous posts: valerian root, GABBA, HTP-5, etc.) in addition to my prescriptions. 

Some nights I’m able to fall asleep but not stay asleep for longer than an hour or two at a time. Then I’m restless and fidgety all night while laying in bed with my eyes closed begging for a wink of sleep. 

Other nights, like tonight, I prepped for bed at 20:00, had my cup of chamomile tea, took my valerian root and prescriptions (clonidine, mirtazapine) and here I am at 03:44 with what I’m convinced has been no sleep. Laying in bed, breathing, counting sheep, you name it; I’ve tried it.

2 sleep studies later, CPAP,APAP, MAD and 4 surgeries later(UPPP, epiglotis removal, tongue base advancement and hyoid bone suspension, left side styloidectomy) and it's the same thing.

I'm in a zombie state through the day bc I think I don't get enough deep sleep(N3) or because of the number of arousals, as a rule more arousals => worse in the daytime.

*I have a vibrating tongue base (i think) when i put my head aginst the wall, i feel a rhytmic fast frequency vibrating through my skull, it turns off when my brain is awake, it returns when i'm falling back asleep. I don't know if this is because of the surgeries or it was there before as i recently discovered it bc of the wall amplification, although I sometimes feel it without the wall when i'm awaken.*

My feet also start twiching when i am asleep, (video recorded) the twiches keep increasing in intensity (PLM index was 6.5/hr) and contribute to the arousals.

There is some snoring that happens, i sometimes also wake up with snore sound even though i don't have an epiglotis anymore.

**I think ALL of the above is contributing in waking me up each night, it's like my body switches into WAR MODE.**

medications:

so far Unisom (Doxylemine) is what i rely on to put me to sleep, but it dosen't work for 2 consecutive nights, i think it make me sleep ""through"" all these arousals, so they keep happening but i go back to sleep faster or i don't feel EACH ONE of the arousals like without medication.

2 years ago I tried clonazepam but very rapidly went from 0.25mg to 4 mg in 3 months so I stopped it.

I tried gabapentin --> no help, made me feel worse.Antidepressants like mirtazapine and trazadone  --> increased my limb jerking each time i go to N1 sleep (drifting to sleep) i jerk awake.

Requip and Mirapex lowest dose --> also prevented me to drift to sleep for the first few hours, then as soon as i fall asleep, I jerk awake, my boidy temperature increase and sleepiness becomes less, i have to weait another 20-30 mns to fall back asllep, and cycle is repeated.

Supplements: --> magnesium(all types), taurine, valerian root, all hypnotic herbs, melatonine, etc.. nothing is dependable.

>Yes, mirtazapine is very helpful for sleep at lower doses (3.75-7.5mg). For me at least. It’s known to have a paradoxical effect in inducing sleep at lower doses. At 3.75mg it felt like almost a 0.25mg-0.5mg of klonopin.",Mirtazapine

I would think it is better to do that instead of taking everyday, if that will help me on those nights that I just need to sleep deep and well.

653,"Feeling almost manic during summertime So I have had intense non-stop insomnia since January, and for periods before that. During summertime, it gets on this really weird level where my body is physically very drained, (high pulse, random chest pains, all over muscle exhaustion) but my mind is so. full. of energy. Like I take diapam, mirtazapin and melatonin and my mind is still racing and as soon as they wear out a bit, I have this overwhelming urge to go for a run or I'll burst. During daytime it's often hard to be very active (normally I go to the gym, run, do parkour, yoga, dancing etc.) but I still at least cook, vacuum, get groceries and care for my plants. And I run/gym on days when I'm only 24-72hrs without sleep. Often times I also go for walks when I've stayed awake for longer. I remember last year many times I was talking and cuddling with my ex but I just couldn't stay still because I was exploding with energy talking really fast and I jusy HAD to do something or I felt like all that energy would rip me apart. Often I went for a run there and then even if I was wearing jeans at the moment.

658,"Seroquel Experience Hi all, I just wanted to see what other people think about my current experience with this medication/diagnosis. 

For the past few weeks I haven't been able to get to sleep until 3-5am which is really unusual for me. When I'd finally get to sleep, I was having incredibly disturbing nightmares nearly every night about my insanely abusive ex finding ways to get back into my life. Some context - I've had her blocked on everything for some time now but she has my address and my dad's phone number and has been sending me letters trying to apologize for what she did, and trying to contact me through my dad, who has been ignoring her because he is fully aware of the situation. All that aside, from the lack of sleep and waking up every morning or afternoon sore from top to bottom and reeling from my nightmares, it's been a pretty rough time. 

I saw my psychiatrist to talk about this and she put me on 200mg of seroquel to take every night. I also take 150mg Lamictal and 45mg Mirtazapine every night. I do not have bipolar or schizophrenia, though I do have pretty severe ADHD and trauma from past experiences. I take 20mg of Focalin twice a day for ADHD which helps me immensely and has never given me trouble getting to sleep. 

From what I've gathered, 200mg of seroquel is a rather high dose.  And it seems to have overall pretty bad reviews. However in my experience so far it's been pretty great. About 2 hours after taking it I get pretty tired and hungry which is good for me. So I've been having a nice snack before bed and I've been getting restful sleep and no intrusive dreams yet in the week I've been taking the seroquel. Also this could be highly subjective but I also feel, how to put it, calm and nostalgic after taking it. I feel like I have very clear and reasonable thoughts before bed. I remember the importance of brushing/flossing my teeth (big for me) and I remember to set alarms and stuff like that. So overall I think it's working well for me?

Does anyone have any thoughts about this?  I can't seem to find much info about people taking this high of a dose for insomnia and absolutely nothing about it being effective for people.",Mirtazapine
659,"No 'SLEEP DRIVE' at all. So here is the thing... I have participated in a programme called 'CBTi' and one of the things that they said to me is, ""ONLY GO TO BED WHEN YOU ARE SLEEPY"". 

The problem is, I am NEVER sleepy! I go days and weeks without sleep and feel so tired but never 'SLEEPY'. When I say 'Weeks', i mean that! 21 days has been the longest i suffered, just couldn't sleep without meds. 

I started suffering from insomnia since January 2021, before my insomnia started I would feel sleepy 'every night' at around 10pm. I used to sleep around 6-7 hours and always felt refreshed. 

I took a medication called 'Olanzapine' as a 'sleep aid' and since I stopped taking that, I just don't get ANY sleep at all on my own, even with sleeping aids I get 0-3hours at the very best (wake up several times). My sleep is broken, ONLY REM sleep and No Slow wave sleep (deep sleep) at all. I always wake up tired, dizzy and feel crap.

Anyone else here suffering 'NO SLEEP DRIVE'? 
If so, how do you overcome this? I have tried exercising, eating healthy, taking supplements etc but nothing helps.. in fact the days I go gym or play football, I struggle to even sleep for '1 hour' even with the use of Mirtazapine (given to me as a sleep aid).

Would really appreciate your responses.",Mirtazapine
660,"CBTI, etc. Hello. This is my first time on Reddit. Looking for support from people who understand. Long story short, I had severe postpartum anxiety after my daughter was born 12 years ago. The main symptom was insomnia. It was 3 months of hell because I didn't know what was happening to me. Once I got on Zoloft, I had much less difficulty sleeping (like once/week or less). Since then I switched to Viibryd and take sleep meds as needed (Remeron/mirtazapine if I have trouble falling asleep and Ambien if I wake in the middle of the night). During the pandemic this was anywhere from 1 to 4 times/week (average = 2), almost exclusively night wakings (exacerbated by hot flashes--yeah, menopause!).

I recently went off Viibryd b/c insurance wouldn't cover it anymore (infuriating!) and decided to start CBT-I to help me deal with anxiety related to sleep. The first night--when I was supposed to get out of bed if I wasn't asleep within 20 minutes--I never fell asleep. The next night, when I was utterly exhausted, I still couldn't fall asleep and took Remeron out of desperation. It also worked the next night, but since then (past 4-5 nights), even  Remeron doesn't get me to sleep. I have to take it with Ambien, so basically the Ambien gets me to fall asleep and the Remeron helps me stay asleep. With this method I've been getting about 5-6 hours, which I can live on. (I cleared this plan with my psychiatrist and the therapist knows I'm back on sleep meds.) The fact that my anxiety is preventing the Remeron from working like it always did is terrifying to me. That was my safety net and now it's gone. I've started doing meditations on the Headspace app and am meeting with the therapist this week re: anxiety reduction strategies (she is putting the sleep restriction part on the back burner). I'm also back on Viibryd, but it will be weeks before that fully kicks in at the therapeutic dose. Took 5mg melatonin last night 1 hour before bed and it did nothing. The Headspace sleepcasts and relaxation exercises during the night have not helped thus far. 

Anyway, for those of you who did CBTI, I'm interested in how it helped you break the anxiety cycle. Even if I tell myself ""I can survive on a few hours' sleep"" or ""I've survived this before, I can do so again"" or ""I can get my work done on little sleep,"" it doesn't seem to help at all. Also, the worst case scenario HAS taken place this last week: I got no sleep at all one night and felt like crap the next day, and being exhausted hasn't helped me fall asleep the next night. My therapist had suggested reframing it as ""this will help build my sleep drive."" And then what happened? I still didn't fall asleep without medication. So I kind of feel like I am lying to myself by saying a bad night of sleep will help my sleep drive. 

I'm a professor and on summer break, so my schedule is more relaxed right now. I have a successful career, financial stability, and a strong support system. I don't have any big deadlines coming up. I.e., I have less stress in my life now than at any point in the past couple years. The main thing I am anxious about is sleep. And I don't know how to break out of this damn cycle. I know worrying about sleep only makes it worse, but I can't seem to make myself not care about getting little sleep.",Mirtazapine
661,"Effective sleep meds that still allow you to function the next day? On and off over the past decade I’ve only ever been prescribed Seroquel/Quetiapine for insomnia.

- Xanax (works great, but addictive)
- Gabapentin (works well but have heard that tolerance grows fast)

664,"New here but have a question about medicine! Hey everyone! I'm new here but I want to know if anyone has any personal experience with this.

I take antidepressants/anxiety medication to help me sleep. I haven't been able to physically fall asleep on my own in well over 15 years. I've been on prescription medicine to make me sleep since before I was a teenager (I'm 29 now).

I was on Seroquel (Quetiapine) since around 2015 because trazodone stopped working (150mg). I got up to 400mg and in recent months, it stopped working. It originally stopped working due to my stomach becoming partially paralyzed (Gastroperisis), so when I got a feeding tube, I'd take it through it and it would work. Well, for a few months now, it started to stop working again. I recently went to my doctor and he switched me to Mirtazapine. We had trouble finding a medicine that was right for me. I've had it for a few days but I haven't tried it yet because I'm afraid that I'll have a bad reaction.

Backstory about being afraid of having a bad reaction: 
I was put on Amitriptyline to see if it would stop the pain I had from my Gastroperisis. I took it once and I had a really bad reaction to it. It made me constantly pass out and I fell so hard in my bathroom that I hurts the whole right side of my body. I'm afraid that the Mirtazapine is going to do the same. My doctor spent some time making sure that the Mirtazapine was in a different drug class than Amitriptyline.

Anyways, long story short: has anyone been on both Seroquel and Mirtazapine? Can you please tell me what each did for you?

I really want to get off the Seroquel, not only because it doesn't work, but because I'd occasionally get hallucinations and pass out (don't think it's fully due to medicine, but idk). I can do all the Googling in the world, but I'd love to hear people's personal experiences with each. Even if you never were on Seroquel, how does the Mirtazapine work for you?

I would go to sleep at 7-9 am and wake up at 4-5 pm which frustrated me to no end. it got especially bad at the end when I spent several hours trying to sleep and when I checked the time, it was freaking 11:30 am.

that was the last straw so I took half a dose of mirtazapine on Monday and tried to reorient my sleep. schedule wise it's been good! I've been sleeping at around 12 am and would wake up at around 5-7 am depending on the day.

the problem now is that during the day I'm EXHAUSTED. My eyes would feel so heavy (can feel it as I type this) and I would occasionally pass out for an extra 1-2 hours and still feel tired after it... what's going on? 

is this a sign of something seriously bad? I never felt like this with the old sleep schedule...  or maybe it's because it was such a drastic change overnight and my body isn't used to the new schedule? (even though if that was the case I think my body would have gotten used to it by now)

They improved sleep quality a lot, but made me sleepy.

I've used a dreem headband which reports like 5-10% REM, 50-55% light sleep and 30% deep sleep with a sleep efficiency of 90%. I'm aware for some of the light sleep which is torture.

Polysomnography turned up false for apnea a few years back, so it's pretty much ruled out even though I do wake myself by snoring sometimes.

Posting just to say that not sleeping is probably worse than sleeping with the help of medicine which can help get you back on track, feeling less stressed and anxious, and helping you to stay productive which also reduces stress and anxiety. I was always afraid of medication but in 2018 when insomnia hit me like a train after a traumatic event in my life, I was wasting away and Mirtazapine helped a lot for the following two years.

So I've been prescribed Mirtazapine 30mg along with Zopiclone 7.5mg at night for insomnia and depression. I take them rogethe with tizanidine 4mg as it counters mirta's adrenergic effects for a short period of time(has a half life of 2.5hours). And I still only get about 4 hours of f***ing sleep.
 I know which issues to credit my insomnia to, and am currently in a very rough period of my life. Had to drop out of college due to the absolutely horrible retardation stress and sleeplessnes have given me. I struggle with typing on a keyboard, basic arithmetic and remebering trivial words, let alone graduating a STEM major. My life is over if I don't recover my mental faculties and I can't recover my mental faculties because I sleep bad.

686,"Everything I know about insomnia **Everything I know about Chronic Insomnia:**

Here are a lot of my thoughts on insomnia, that I have written over the last two years while I worked on curing my chronic insomnia. It’s long, but then again so is the process of battling insomnia. I was going to post this as a response to a specific topic but actually I thought I might as well start a separate thread. In the interest of full disclosure, I was diagnosed with chronic insomnia on top of GAD, and went through ACT therapy with added help from Amitriptyline - a sedative antidepressant. Before this I tried just about everything: ignoring it until it goes away, sleeping pills, Benzos, trazodone, Seroquel, Mirtazapine, Lyrica... to no avail. 

&#x200B;

A lot of the points below is from personal research, and help from my psychiatrist. I really hope they will give some sufferers hope, relief, and a good base to start on to get through this mental health issue. 

Insomnia is essentially a phobia of sleep. It is caused by one of the most ancient parts of your mind in evolutionary terms, the amygdala, which is responsible for your fear responses, and fight or flight mode. It’s also part of our subconscious, ie we do not have a way to rationally control it as it highjacks the rational part of our brain. 

\-There are two main therapy approaches to curing insomnia:

\-CBT: 

Here you look to change your negative thought patterns around sleep, and replace them with new positive thoughts around sleep. In order to rekindle the equation bed = sleep in the subconscious part of your mind, CBT also imposes a strict regimen including exercise every day, sleep restriction, and getting out of bed every time you can’t fall asleep in 20 mins.

This method works, but over all, studies seem to show on the long term it is less beneficial than ACT (see below). For people with naturally sceptical minds, it’s not easy to change negative thoughts by a simple rational process. I had trouble with this myself.

\-ACT and mindfulness.

Here you look at both noticing your negative thinking patterns, and accepting the discomfort stemming from both the negative thoughts and emotions around sleep, and around the tiredness during the day. 

\-First, It’s important to realise that you cannot control the thoughts that go through your mind - however, it is possible to control how you react to them. A natural human response is to try and immediately shut down thoughts that lead to negative sensations or discomfort. For eg, if I tell you that tomorrow when you get in your car to go to work, you might have an accident and die - your mind automatically discards this possibility as unreasonable, and it works. However when an anxiety disorder is developed, this process doesn’t work anymore and becomes part of the problem: the more you try to avoid and / or shutdown powerful negative thoughts, the more they come back and the stronger they become.

With ACT, over time, you learn to welcome and accept negative thoughts instead of fighting them. This sounds impossible but it’s not. There have been many, many nights before you developed insomnia where you probably got short sleep by choice: decided to stay up late to watch a film or talk to someone, decided to go out late before a school / work day, or just having sex with a partner etc… And it never bothered you: proof that you can know that you will be tired tomorrow, or not sleep well tonight, and be ok with it.

This is very powerful because once you start putting this into practice, with time you improve, and after a period of time, you actually enable your mind to be in a relaxed enough state to finally find sleep. It is counterintuitive, but if you think about it, when you didn’t have any sleep problems, if you’d gone to bed and you thought about what if you didn’t fall asleep or slept only a few hours etc… ie all the negative thoughts you currently get: you would still have slept a normal night back then, because it wouldn’t have triggered the anxiety response that keeps you awake today. The point is it is possible to go to sleep while having these thoughts, so long as your reaction to these thoughts doesn’t trigger anxiety.

ACT also recommends that you assign a name, an image to your negative sleep thoughts. For example for myself I chose to label my insomnia as my ‘Insomnia bear’. Bears hibernate all winter and when they come out in Spring, they are groggy, hungry and in a bad mood. When I notice my negative thoughts coming in, I see them as a grumpy bear, and I lie in bed and imagine myself taming the bear, and cuddling it… with time this helped me feel comfortable and put a smile on my face. 

Lastly, turning pain into purpose can help you alleviate the pain. For example, if instead of relating completely negatively with your insomnia you change your view on how you look at it, and manage to see it in a positive light, it will help get over the discomfort. Your initial thought while reading this is probably that this is just mental: how can there be any positives with insomnia? 

For me, what really started my insomnia was stimulant drugs use and big long nights partying. For a while I tried to cure the insomnia to be able to go back to living like I did before. It worked for a while but inevitably came back. In the end, I decided to see my insomnia as my mind telling me to pursue a more fulfilling life: I didn’t do loads of sport just in order to cure the insomnia, but instead my insomnia was the reason that led me to drastically improve my fitness by focusing on a healthier lifestyle (I wouldn’t have if I hadn’t had sleep issues). I learnt a lot about my own psychology thanks to insomnia - something I had never cared about before, and which has helped me improve performance everywhere including at work and in my relationships with friends. I am more in tune with my emotions and more empathetic towards others than before. After years of partying and not having any serious meaningful relationships, I finally settled down with a girl I love. 

In terms of how long it takes, everyone is different, and ACT is not easy to implement: it’s more of long term strategy. Usually people start noticing a difference after 4-6 weeks when it comes to their sleep, and a study by the sleep school shows sleep continues to improve over a period of a year. Essentially, your sleep comes back to an acceptable level (say 5-6h / night) within several weeks, but then the last hour or two is longer to get, as it is less physically ‘needed’ by your mind and body: you feel a bit tired during the day but sleep drive isn’t as strong as when you were sleeping just a few hours a night.

A few more tips and thoughts:

\-A premise to getting better is to understand there is nothing physically wrong with you, and you will sleep normally again one day. I was super scared originally as a brain MRI showed an anomaly that could have been a blood clot - which, considering my drug use, could have meant there was something physically wrong. My GP and psychiatrist disagreed with this though, and in time I managed to get over this fright.

Thought processes:

Above I talk about how, when a thought generates discomfort, we tend to try and block the thoughts out of our mind, and how this doesn’t work once negative thoughts reach a certain power, after which it snowballs the other way. It took me a long time to realise this and even today, I still do it a bit. Whenever something scary pops into my mind, I just think - no, don’t think about it. 

For the insomnia, I changed this habit and actually forced myself to think about it during the day: essentially it’s the concept of exposure therapy if you like. I think about it in a ‘safe’ and pleasant setting, and it would help me think about sleep without losing control of my thoughts. So for example, take a few times a day (morning, lunch, evening?) where you sit with your own thoughts and dedicate some time to thinking about sleep. Tell yourself a positive story on sleep, so that you look forward to going to bed. In other words, fake it till you make it (more on positive thoughts that helped me below).

Another trick: Looking forward to the discomfort. This is sort of related to finding the meaning in the discomfort explained above. 

For example: you’ve got a big event tomorrow - something stressful at work, or an important date, or a social event you want to be on form for. You’re anxious, you know you won’t sleep well. And that’s the truth: you won’t; and yes, you will be at least a little tired tomorrow. But I’ve found that sometimes by going to bed ‘knowing’ that it’s not going to be a good night, and not hoping that I’ll sleep, the night turns out to be better than expected. 

Sleep is essentially a performance anxiety: if you went to bed every night not expecting to sleep and you literally did not care whether you fell asleep or not, you’d sleep again within weeks. If you trick your mind into thinking that’s it’s perfectly OK to lie awake in bed, and that actually resting and relaxing is fine and just as enjoyable, it’ll go a long way in helping you solve the problem. 

On the topic of anxiety in general, in many cases, the feeling generated by the thought of the bad thing happening is much worse than the actual feeling you get when the bad thing happens. When it comes to sleep: that tug of war to stop your mind from thinking about sleep, the pounding heart at 2am, the warm bursts that make you chuck you duvet off the bed because you’re sweating from the stress - isn’t that actually worse than just being tired the next day because you didn’t sleep enough? Think of all those nights where you were out late and had to do stuff the next day: did it make you want to cry from being overwhelmed?

The key here is that by relieving yourself of any hopes and expectations, you let go of any anxiety. This is actually one of the premises of Buddhism by the way, and is applicable to all forms of stress and anxiety. 

Meditation and mindfulness: This is just awesome, and so powerful. Patience is key here: you won’t see any difference in the first two weeks, and it will likely take months before you personally notice the difference - yet people around you may notice sooner. Essentially, meditation gives you perspective on your own thoughts. We rarely stop to think about what we are thinking or why we are thinking it. When your mind is broken into an unhealthy pattern, sitting with your own thoughts is a prerequisite to getting better. Other positives include stronger ability to concentrate, a calmer, relaxed energy, less anger and negative emotions etc…

Exercising is key, but don’t over do it. At mild doses, it helps boost your energy levels, but if you are sleeping 2-3h a night, it’s also draining in terms of energy. You don’t want to run down your entire metabolism, so listen to what your body is telling you. In fact, even if you were sleeping normally, would you try and exercise 1h a day 7 days a week? Unless you are a serious athlete, no - you’d be broken after two weeks. That’s also a part of the healing process: be nice to yourself, don’t judge yourself too harshly if you can’t run a half marathon after 2h sleep etc… It’s fine, there will be many opportunities, and patience is key. 

Caffeine: I never liked the Spartan approach of no caffeine until the problem is solved. It’s important not to drink too much coffee / coke etc, and not too late in the day, but if you really enjoy a cup of coffee as part of your morning routine, well… let yourself enjoy it! The caffeine is not the cause of chronic insomnia, and insomnia can go away without having to give it up.

Lastly, some positive thoughts that helped me overcome the nightmare:

\-Don’t be afraid of tiredness: it’s part of the healing process, as it’s just your mind and body working hand in hand to build your sleep drive.

\-There will be many more bad nights: that too is part of the healing process. Look forward to experiencing the discomfort of lying awake in bed.

\-It’s OK to be awake at night: simply focus on resting and relaxing, which is something within your control

\-Remember there is meaning in discomfort: getting used to bad nights and living a normal life despite the tiredness contributes to building character strength that you will benefit from your whole life. Aim to achieve as much as you can on whatever sleep you get.

\-Do not overthink bad nights: when you wake up, take some time to collect your thoughts before you crack on with your day, and then focus on putting all your energy into living your life and influencing things you have some control over, rather than wasting it worrying about something you can’t control. 

\-When negative thoughts come, don’t try and shut them down: try to notice, welcome and accept them. 

\-I’ve had many short nights before. In fact I’ve had nights where I’ve been out all night, didn’t sleep at all and had to travel or do something the next day. I felt bad but I got done whatever I needed to get done.

\-Is it really that bad? Think about the last 12 months. What do you remember of them? Is it just a series of panic attacks in bed? Probably not: you probably remember the fun, enjoyable moments. Holidays, moments with friends or family - on some of these days where I was knackered, I don’t remember being tired, I remember having fun: it shows it’s not as bad as our perception of the bloody thing.

\-Don’t let sleep anxiety get in the way of enjoying your life. That’s a problem I had with CBT: going to bed ALWAYS at the same time, is not always possible when you want to live a normal life: if it’s your mate’s birthday, it doesn’t matter if you’re not in bed by midnight and get back at 3am because you stayed out. Those memories are worth it. Don’t miss out on a holiday because you don’t want to be jet lagged. In a word, don’t try and avoid tiredness. 

\-I Actually sleep a lot better than I think. 

\-Don’t be worried or judge myself about taking medication: I should not set myself time limits, and should not focus on solving the sleep problem which has pretty much been solved. Instead, I should focus on the meaningful things in my life.

ACT is also extremely powerful tool because once you have learnt to implement it to cure insomnia, you can actually use it to fight other forms of anxiety in life.

If you’re interested on this topic, I would also recommend reading about Stoicism - a form of Ancient Greek philosophy which holds a lot of answers to some of the most meaningful questions we ask ourselves in periods of doubt and discomfort. 

We need to remember: life is a lot easier now than it was in the past and humans are incredibly resilient. For thousands of years we’ve lived in the world when child mortality rates were 50%, where famines, pandemics and wars came regularly and killed 20-50% of everyone we knew, and where people have survived concentration camps. For many of us, getting through insomnia is the hardest thing we’ll ever do

687,"Histamine Receptor Tolerance? So my understanding is that off label prescribed drugs like: Hydroxyzine( a pure antihistamine)  Seroquel, Trazadone and Mirtazapine all basically cause sleep by attaching to the H1 receptors in the brain. I'm guess that eventually you will get down regulation of these receptors and tolerance builds to the effects, which is where I'm at. I was at Seroquel 25mg for a little then 50 to 75 worked for a long while and then 75 always which hasn't really worked much. PNP prescribed Mirtazapine 15 mg - I accidentally took 30 the first night and the next day was dead - then I took 15 and got sleep but was still pretty dead the next day, tried 7.5 and that didn't really work so ended up with 22.5 that night, and finally took 15 and then another 7.5 when that didn't work, and still basically nothing maybe an hour or two of sleep. I'm guessing now that my H1 receptors are just completely fried and down regulated, meaning I'm screwed in the terms of non-narcotic sleep aids at the moment. Which would explain the Mirtazapine tachyphalxis/rapid failure to work.",Mirtazapine
688,"Have you tried sedative antidepressants? Hey there, 

&#x200B;

So I had really bad insomnia for a year or so in 2018/19 (down from 7h normal sleep to 2-4h), eventually I caved and went to see a psychiatrist. We tried a few things (Lyrica and trazodone didn't work at all, Mirtazapine helped but I was KO the whole day after), and eventually I was put on Amitriptyline up to 100mg, which was too much so came back down to 50mg which was just right. Took a few weeks to help, after 6 weeks or so I was back to 6h / night which is when I knew I'd won. 

Weirdly my cousin also had serious issues with sleep that year (down to 2 straight nights with no sleep at all) and was prescribed mirtazapine which was a God send for her. Note that her psychiatrist also signed her off work for a month while antidepressants took effect: the argument was that to get to the point where she'd had no sleep for two consecutive nights, she had completely exhausted her central nervous system to the point where it wasn't a question of doing sport or walking around in the sun light: the first week was in a private clinic (essentially a room in a psychiatrist ward), before going through a slow mental rehab process with the help of medication. 

&#x200B;

I'm mentioning this as I've seen a few ppl post about not wanting to take medication. I find that there is still a stigma around psyche meds. Antidepressant are called as such because they are a primary care treatment for depression, but they are also offer help to manage anxiety and insomnia - although release will never be immediate. it's not just with the sleep part that it helps: it also helps organise your thoughts during the day and apply techniques for ACT and CBT for example. Neither myself or my cousin were ever diagnosed with depression - but to be honest, the awful sleep, the lack of motivation to do anything in the day and the ruminating thoughts around the sleep issue making us feel low are the top 3 symptoms of clinical depression (more common than 'feeling sad or low' according to my psychiatrist). 

&#x200B;

In my opinion this is at least worth a serious go: we all take meds when we get physically sick, so what's the problem with taking medication when we have a serious mental health issue (which insomnia is - let's face it). 

&#x200B;

I really hope some insomnia sufferers will find some help with these meds - can't imagine where I'd be if I hadn't been prescribed amitriptyline.

691,"Any insights on my 2 month battle with insomnia? In mid January I had some really bad insomnia that led to me getting nearly zero sleep for like 4 or 5 days. My doctor prescribed me Trazodone, and the first night I tried it, it did jack. She then prescribed Mirtazapine, which actually did work. I did almost a week taking the full 15mg pill, then almost a week of half pills. I tried going off of it, and the first night I got a great sleep, then half a night the next, and the third I was up all night. I figured maybe I got off the pills too quickly or something. I did I think a couple weeks back on a full pill, then like a couple more on half, and now I was on week two of quarters. I decided Earlier this week I'd try quarters every other day. Tuesday I skipped, had trouble falling asleep but eventually did halfways through the night. Wednesday I took the quarter pill, slept perfectly. Last night I skipped, basically didn't sleep except for a couple hour long ""naps"" right before my normal wake up time. So there's some backstory.

My concern is how I'm not falling asleep. Even before I started meds I noticed myself jerking awake as I attempted to fall asleep. The past couple days, and before when I tried to stop, it's been super pronounced. Like I can almost feel it in my brain, drifting off and then suddenly alert. And sometimes it's my arm or leg jerking. I've been taking magnesium citrate supplements for the past month hoping that'd help. Also, since I've started the Mirtazapine, I've noticed muscle twitches/spasms that I don't normally have. They're not constant, but I have noticed them

Any insights or advice? 

I have 4.75 pills left, I'll probably call my doctor again next week at some point and go over my journey before I run out

692,"As soon as i start to fall asleep i get startled/brain zap and wake up again Anyone experience anything like this? I have very strong anxiety but I never had a problem with sleep until a few weeks ago. 

The night before I got my first vaccine dose I could barely sleep because I had read about how you have to get a good night's sleep to have a vaccine work fully, and the anxiety of thinking about how I have to sleep made it harder to sleep. 

But the real problem started a few weeks later. I had been trying to solidify my sleep schedule so I would be able to sleep for my second dose and I tried multiple different doses of melatonin, everything from 12mg all the way down to .3. And I started having a feeling of ""brain zaps"" much like when you come off an SSRI. 

After taking one dose of .3mg melatonin one night the problem started where every time I start to fall asleep i get startled brain zap feeling.  It feels like a jolt to my head and chest. It is a lot like a hypnic jerk. Sometimes it is a full hypnic jerk with the muscle jerk, sometimes without. 

It is also not just at the moment of falling asleep that I feel it. Any little noise or movement can also give me this startle. I have tried mirtazapine and seroquel in the past week but neither have helped. They do make me tired but no matter how tired I get I still get this jolt. 

Is this just from anxiety? It feels like something more could be going on and I'm concerned maybe messing around the melatonin dose too much did something to my brain.

It took me HOURS to fall asleep until middle school. I started melatonin then and had a few years of okay sleep. In high school I went back to sleeping 2-5 hours a night.

I take naps just to get through the day, which I'm sure isn't good for my overall sleep schedule, but if don't do that then my sheep deprivation causes my physical (and mental) health issues to get a lot worse - at which point I'm completely incapable of working or conducting my life. Of course, my physical health issues make my sleep worse, since pain makes it difficult to sleep. Being in a hyperadrenergic state also sucks for sleep because my body releases adrenaline at mostly random times, which makes sleep physically impossible until the adrenaline cools off.

What I do every night: these things sort of work.

Basic sleep hygiene / routine / limiting blue light exposure

Melatonin (if I don't take it, I just never get sleepy)

Magnesium

L-theanine (cannot fall asleep if I forget this)

Hydroxyzine (trialing, uncertain)

Meditation (silent)

CBT

ACT


As needed:

Tizanidine for muscle tightness also helps sleep

Xanax

Guided meditation


Things I've tried that don't work:

Trazadone (no effect)

Benadryl (minimal effect)

Gabapentin (I take this for pain, no effect on sleep)

Tricyclic antidepressants (these make me horribly ill)

Mirtazapine


I've made an appointment with a sleep specialist. I don't know what else to do. My partner also has sleep problems so sometimes we exacerbate each other. Any suggestions welcome. I'm at the end of my rope and I'm exhausted.",Mirtazapine
698,"Insomnia still getting worse after 7 years of suffering. I started having insomnia about 7 years ago, it started with just being unable to fall asleep and the lack of feeling tired. I was still in school back then, so since I had to get up, I had an average amount of 3-5 hours of sleep per day. Things progressively started to get worse after leaving school, I wouldn't sleep more than 2-4 hours due to work schedule. Quit work due to other severe mental health issues. The past few years things got really weird. I still struggle with falling asleep and lack of feeling tired, I only get tired after approximately 20 hours of being awake. I use seroquel to help sleep earlier, but I have to gradually up my dosis, being at 200mg each night at the moment, and I still take around 4-5 hours to fall asleep after taking it, so I'm about to up my dosis again, which is not on recommendation by my therapist, usually I dont even tell her anymore because I'm so tired of this. On top of that I struggle severely with waking up as well, I cant get out of that state of drowsiness/experiencing excessive sleepiness. I sleep an average of 12-14 hours until I'm able to wake up properly and have control over my body. This happens being on and also being off of seroquel. No one knows what's wrong with me, and due to my other existing mental illnesses I cant bring myself to go to a specialist to check my brain overnight. My therapist also told me they sometimes/usually want their patients off their medication, but that means I wont sleep at all, which is pure torture to me. My anxiety also makes me very afraid of foreign places, and going there alone sounds even worse. I'm at a point where I just dont know what to do anymore. Professionals refuse to prescribe me benzos, and apparently there's nothing else other than seroquel for them to prescribe me, besides things like mirtazapin/remeron, which i tried 4 years ago and its effectiveness rapidly declined too. Nothing seems to help; sports dont help, being active/busy all day doesnt help, home remedies dont help, relaxing music/sounds dont help. It's also apparently not triggered by my other mental health conditions. The only thing my therapist mentioned is trauma, but I dont think of these things when falling asleep at all/I dont have regular flashbacks, neither do I have any nightmares. 
I feel like nothing of this is ever going to be better, on top of that, no one besides my therapists takes this matter seriously. The psychiatrist who prescribes my medication sounded like I'm just wanting to abuse the medication and thinks doing something during the day will fix my issues: I feel completely alone and misunderstood. I wish to feel heard, understood and being taken seriously, but I dont seem to find any of that in my surroundings... I'm just really tired of all of this.",Mirtazapine
699,"Withdrawal help 
Hey so I stopped taking mirtazapine last week. I was on it for a total of two months. Basically the first month was 12.5 mg and 15 mg and last two weeks were 7.5 mg. I took 3.5 Tuesday evening and haven’t taken it since. I’ve been waking up exactly an hour and a half after going to bed and suffering with pretty bad insomnia.

I went through a traumatic event and possibly contracted covid in late april of last year and now I’m suffering from awful inner vibration, restlessness and I never feel sleepy anymore(but I do feel exhausted). I’ve got really bad tinnitus now that I didn’t have before. I have light and sound sensitivity. I have really bad anhedonia. I have really bad brain fog and I can’t concentrate on anything. I basically feel like a complete zombie. It feels like my nervous system is completely out of whack but I have no clue how to start sleeping again so I can heal.

I’ll sometimes feel so exhausted like I need a nap, but most of the time I lay down and just can’t fall asleep. I used to nap like a baby especially if I didn’t get enough sleep the night before. Now I can never get enough sleep.

I’ve tried melatonin and benadryl. I’ve been prescribed trazodone and mirtazapine which seemed to knock me out but made my symptoms worse upon waking. It didn’t feel like restful sleep. I have completely switched up to an anti-inflammation/low-histamine diet. I’ve only been on it for a few days so I want to give it some time.

Well it completely stopped working again. I’m sick of switching dosages last night I took only a quarter of a 15 mg to see if that would help. And yet again no sleep.. wel barely. I’m trying to just stop taking it because it’s no benefit to me. I’m wondering how long the side effects will last of insomnia from stopping it altogether.

702,"Benzo's for insomnia? 

I've not taken benzo's for about a year but recently my insomnia has become unbearable. I thought Clonazepam with no telerance would help but I've taken 12mgs over the space of 5hours and I fell wide awake, energetic even. I hear people falling asleep from 0.5-1mg so this is really frustrating. I guess I choose the wrong benzo and should have done more research but I thought after not taking any for so long that they woukd work.

Any suggestions? I've tried Magnesium and Bacopa but also no success. And Mirtazapine was prescribed for depression which had the best effect of knocking me out but I was so groggy the next day I would not be able to get out of bed. This is related to depression. I know this sounds like I'm exagerrating but insomnia is making my life hell when I also have to work.

What would you recommend for insomnia? Zopiclone? Temazapam? I tried GBH but even that didn't work. I'm so desperate I may try get hold of Rohypnol.

Also important to add that I'm in the UK which is at the opposite extreme of the US by very rarely prescribing benzo's.I feel like this constant lack of sleep is going to kill me and benzo;s, despite knowing how dangerous they are, are they only way out.

Please any advice will be appreciated and thoroughly read and taken on board.

703,"What are your experiences with zolpidem VS quetiapine (low-dose) for sleep? Hi, I have been having problems with sleep for the past several years. I also struggle with generalized anxiety disorder, panic attacks, and depression. For the past 15 years, I have tried numerous different psychiatric medications, and over that time, I've developed insomnia and sleep problems. 

For the past 1-2 years, I have been taking zolpidem 7.5mg in combination with promethazine 25mg (antihistamine drug) almost every night, to be able to fall asleep and to stay asleep ( however it's not working for every night at all). 

Instead of zolpidem, I have tried trazodone (50 - 100mg), which didn't work and didn't sit well with me. It made me feel dizzy, light-headed, and foggy the next day. I also woke up during the night and I wasn't able to fall asleep again. In the past, I tried mirtazapine which I have found helpful for sleep, however, I slept for 12 hours straight on it and I couldn't tolerate side effects (such as the next day drowsiness and especially weight gain) even on the lowest dosage. With zolpidem, I can wake up the next day, drink coffee, and I am ready to go. With those two other drugs (trazodone, mirtazapine) I am dizzy, drowsy, brain fogged, and confused the next day.

Recently my doctor prescribed me quetiapine 25mg for sleep support. Since I had negative experiences with trazodone and mirtazapine, I am not very keen on trying this one.  

Can you please tell, what are your experiences with quetiapine 25mg and how would you compare it to zolpidem in terms of the next day side effects?

Thank you!",Mirtazapine
704,"Trying to get off mirtazapine. I'm seriously at my wit's end here. For three years I had been on a combo of mirtazapine and venlafaxine – 30mg and 225mg respectively – for SSRI resistant depression (with sleep disturbance.)  I successfully weaned myself off venlafaxine in early October and a few weeks later started to wean myself off mirtazapine. I started by reducing my dose to 22.5mg which I stuck to for 2 weeks, then down to 15mg for another 2 then down to 7.5mg for a further two weeks. Following that, I started taking 7.5mg every other night for three weeks. 

This was all successful and aside from intermittent bouts of anxiety I was feeling good. However, when I attempted to go longer than two nights without mirtazapine the insomnia kicked me in the arse. So now I'm stuck at taking 7.5mg every other night or dealing with insomnia. It's stressing me out because it's interfering with my mental health recovery. A huge part of staying mentally healthy for me is working out, powerlifting specifically. It keeps me focused and goal orientated and that's so important. But you can't powerlift if you can't sleep because you'll just burn out and injure yourself. So I don't know guys, I'm just fucking stressing and I don't know what to do.",Mirtazapine
705,"Trazodone made me feel awake and feverish So I’ve tried just about everything for insomnia. The only way I can get a few hours is with ambien, but I wake up after about 2-3 and am wide awake again. I am trying hard not to build up a ridiculous tolerance again so I asked doc for something else. Mirtazapine worked well for two nights, then never again. And I don’t think it’s meant to be as-needed so that was a bust.

So doctor gave me trazodone. Sweet, that’s what my dog takes for anxiety, now we’re twinsies. But oh my god I felt like death all. Fucking. Night. I took 100mg because that’s what he gave me and never any indication I should be cutting them in half or anything. I felt like my heart was racing yet my blood pressure hit the damn floor, I was dizzy even lying down and getting up to use the bathroom felt legit dangerous. I didn’t sleep at all. I just lied there feeling sick. I still feel dizzy and my head feels weird.

I’ve read a ton of mixed reviews here about trazodone, but a ton of people says it’s a miracle drug minus the hangover.  Did I take too much the first night?? I even asked my dog how much she takes, and she’s on 100mg every day. I weight a bit more so I figured that’s a fine place to start. Wrong, I guess! 

Did I fuck this up right from the start? Should I have cut the pills in half? Now I’m scared to try again because of how horrible my night was. It did not even make me feel the least bit sleepy. I only felt alert and dizzy and sick. Would this happen again even if I cut the pill into quarters or in half...? The pill DOES have lines on it as if cutting it should be normal but the doctor never mentioned that. 

Anyway I’d love to hear your experiences or see if anyone felt like me after taking it. Thanks guys


EDIT: Well despite the doc having a list of my meds I am apparently having some interactions which might explain why I had/ am still having such horrible symptoms. I’m also taking Wellbutrin and lamictal and apparently they interact? Be careful of that, everyone.

706,"Bedtime PTSD I’ve not done a post like this before but I feel so alone I was hoping there is someone out there that understands what I’m going through.

I used to be able to sleep anywhere but 2 years ago, a stressful job eventually gave me insomnia. It started once or twice a month, then a few times a week, then everyday to the point I didn’t sleep 5 nights in a row. It affected me so badly that I lost my job. I was prescribed mirtazapine but this makes me a total zombie the next day so now with my new job I struggle to do anything productive in the mornings. I have tried to lower my dosage to combat this but it’s clear that now I am psychologically hooked. I literally do everything - hot baths, meditation, breath work, read boring text books... but none of it works. It’s like when bed time comes around, I’ve had so many nights now where I am staring at the ceiling still unable to drop off. It will be like 4am and I’m hating myself for how awful il feel the next day to the point that I contemplate being better off dead, because at least I would never have to deal with another night of this. When it comes to bed time my heart races and I can’t catch my breath sometimes . 

I just don’t know what to do. It’s affecting my close relationships and I’ve become the complete opposite person to who I usually am. I just don’t see a way out. I’m sure from this board I’m not the only one. Has anyone broken this cycle I’m in?",Mirtazapine

I noticed my diet (and multivitamin) is completely void of magnesium. I was going to just get a magnesium supplement but reading on this sub people mention magnesium citrate and magnesium glycinate.

710,"Need some kind of sleeping medication due to chronic insomnia, but have run out of options for things to try, what medication options can I still try? (desperate and scared) To make a long story short, I've suffered with a sleep disorder for 15 years now. Despite immense amount of testing/studies, the experts aren't sure what I have, with the best guess being a type of the REM sleep behavior disorder. The one thing that was still going for me was I was able to fall asleep pretty much right away, that is, until a very traumatic event in Oct 2018. Since then I've suffered from worsening chronic insomnia, in addition to severe anxiety, depression, and stress due to many real life situations and being in a very bad spot in life for the past 2+ years.

Since the Oct 2018 event, I've needed sleep medication to get to sleep. Unfortunately things have worsened and the things that were at least kind of working no longer are, or have major side effects where I can't take them anymore. I don't know what to do or what to try anymore. Here's what I've tried (PS: I would have already tried marijuana if it was legal in WI, but it's not, thank you backwards ass government):

&#x200B;

* Ambien / Zolpidem IR and ER: I'm at the max 12.5 dosage and it only gets me slightly tired and lasts 3-4 max, I'm then wide awake
* Remrom / Mirtazapine: Had some effectiveness, but caused severe weight gain in a very short amount of time each time I tried it. I'm talking 10-15 pounds in 2-3 weeks. I couldn't fit into clothes I normally could anymore.
* Klonopin / Clonazepam: Also the 'gold standard' for REM sleep behavior disorder, but not effective for me. Had some insomnia effectiveness in the past, but recent trials on it caused me to have severe panic attacks. It also seems to have caused morning panic attack or restless leg syndrome in the past month where I wake up around 6 and can't get back to bed because I HAVE to move my legs.
* Catapres / Clonidine: Made me slightly groggy but didn't help me stay asleep. Recently it seems to actually have interrupted my REM sleep as it seemed I would wake up every time I was about to dream and continue having constant wakeups at night.
* Desyrel / Trazodone: Slightly worked but also had an allergic reaction to it even in relatively low doses which caused my nose to plug up and difficulty breathing.
* Seroquel / Quetiapine IR: Same issue as Trazodone only much more severe. Had issues at 100mg and the first night I took it at 200mg I nearly had to call an ambulance because it closed up my throat where I had to stay sitting up until started to wear off as otherwise I'd asphyxiate myself.
* Melatonin: Tried various mg amounts. Causes lots of weird dreams, but does almost nothing to get or stay asleep.
* Diphenhydramine: Apparently I'm one of those who it doesn't work on. Barely has any effect if at all.",Mirtazapine
711,"Is a heart rate increase during insomnia normal? So Sunday night I could not sleep at all. Pretty sure I got zero sleep throughout the night. Monday night I felt tired, went to bed early, then woke up immediately an hour later. This happen a couple more times, maybe got 3 hours of sleep. By this point I'm terrified about fatal insomnia like I see a lot of people are. Same thing happens Tuesday night, like 3 or so hour bursts of sleep. I called my doctor Wednesday about it and that night I'm pretty sure I got zero sleep. Thursday she calls me back and sets me up with a prescription for Trazodone. At work I noticed my pulse being higher than normal. I ended up going home because I was so stressed and anxious. I took the meds that night and they didn't help. No sleep all night except maybe half an hour or so before I got out of bed. I called my doctor again and mentioned the heart rate stuff. By high I mean it hovered in the 90s and probably 100s when I'm standing when I'm used to it being high 70s low 80s. She thought maybe it was a reaction to the Trazodone. Due to me being stressed, I forgot to tell her I noticed it before I took it until I hung up. Nevertheless she put me on Mirtazapine (15mg). I took some last night and it really seemed to help. I slept for 10 hours, albeit in 2-3 hour chunks. And this morning my heart rate seemed ok. But then increased again as I started getting ready for work. And all day at work it has been elevated.

My GPs don't seem to care and just give me melatonin or some plant based crap while I keep on telling them is really serious.

I have some CBD oil now and I feel like overdosing myself with it if that is possible. Has no damn effect, I feel like drinking the entire bottle with some booze. 

Last year I have been through a major depressive episode and a psychiatrist prescribed me some Mirtazapine, which acts also as a sleeping pill.

For the past 5 days now its been putting me to sleep, but Holy hell If it doesn't knock me out and make me drowsy af waking up. I've been sleeping for about 9-11 hours a day after taking it, and the only reason I'm not sleeping longer is because I have to get up about 9pm to come to my grandma's place to take care of her.

I can't just wake up and leave the house either. I'm so groggy and sluggish when I first wake up that I don't feel comfortable driving. I also struggle just sitting up. I honestly feel worse after getting that much sleep then before when I was sleeping at most 3 hours a night (and that was on a goodnight).

So my first question is, is this regular for a lot of people? Secondly, will grogginess and sluggish feeling go away? I've been on multiple drugs to try and help me sleep (ambien, Ativan, Klonopine, trazadone, belsomra, Xanax, and a couple more) and none have ever made me this groggy. I know with mirtazapine that the lower the dosage, the more sedating it is, and the Dr started me off at 15mg. If this feeling doesn't go away, I'm not going to be able to keep taking it.

If this is true, why have multiple doctors (it's a different one every time you call) signed off on this?Also has anyone else's sleep improved at a higher dose (not including when combined with another antidepressant)? And has anyone had the experience that the solution was to *reduce* the dose, say to 7.5?

At this point I don't care if I get sad, I just want to be able to sleep like a normal person

I keep going into states of jallucinating badly, very paranoid, cant stand to be around anyone, irrational,constant crying, body feels so waek i feel like im going to collapse, time distortion, can't remember much of who l am anymore it feels like this week has lasted 10 years..

I am already on zopiclone for a year every night and it only worked for a month really to get me 4-5.hours a night.. since then it stopped working but I kept taking it out of fear to stop ive repeatedly rang my doctor,mental health team and noone can do anything, they added teazadone which I have taken for 3 days, it has just made me physicallu feel more drowsy and exhausted but not let me sleep, it feels like my stress hormones are just so high I can't switch my mind off.. ive tried all the normal things..  the last few days I have had to give up exercise as I'm too worn out to move. I'm becoming suicidal half of the day. I just dont know what to do as I feel too tired to sleep... well my body conked out after 4 days but then its ready to start the cycle again.

Health background-  im 25 year old female, endometreosis aneamic for many years undiagnosed that caused chronic fatigue and POTS, much better now im taking the mini pill and a high dose of iron.  now my thyroid is quite  underactive and trending worse but they taking a wait and see approach and re test in 2 months . I also have a bladder condition which means I have pain everyday and up 10-20 times a night to pee but I had this way before the sleep problems and i would get up and go back to sleep very easily back then.. also since developing sleep problems I gained 70lbs very rapidly... not sure if due to taking mirtazapine for almost a year up until recently, my diet has not changed that much other than having to eat a snack when I'm awake all night which is always a healthy one. And I have become depressed over the last year and experienced a lot ot suicidal episodes.

I'm sorry this is long and jumbled, im normally a little more articulate than this, basically to sum it up, im having the worst spell I've ever had and am failing to get any medical help as I already take meds that dont work and have tried lots of others, i went to the hospital suicidal before the evulated that I was sane despite saying I was suicidal and sent me out.. i sat out on the main road in the middle of the night and had to be physically put into a taxi..

I dont know anymore. Just any comfort would help so much right now.. everyone in my life is angry with me.",Mirtazapine
725,"sleep aides/meds and/or tips for making yourself sleep while being medicated for adhd and having a high tolerance for melatonin? this post got really long and a bit venty, apologies in advance, I wrote it as my meds kicked in and they can make me long-winded lol. TLDR at the end!

so I've had problems with sleep for years, mostly because 1) my brain just wants to stay awake and keep getting dopamine from activities/stimulation [adhd] and now 2) I'm pretty sure I just don't get tired/sleepy like I used to anymore, even before being medicated for adhd. either my circadian rhythm is 4-8 hours longer than most people, or I just dont get tired or have naturally low melatonin compared to others. 

a few years ago I was on meds for sleep (mirtazapine - also an antidepressant) that MADE me either go to bed or fall asleep on the floor. this was very ideal because there's nothing else I can seem to do to get my brain to calm down enough to actually try to sleep. I got to the highest dose eventually, then due to some problems with my psych, ended up having to stop cold turkey about a year ago, and have had awful sleep patterns since. 

this also seemingly made me pretty much intolerant to melatonin and a few other sleep aides I've tried. I know the recommended dose for melatonin is super low, but given that other sleep aides and higher doses of melatonin just arent enough for me to override my brain, I'm not sure if that'll work for me.

I have a new psychiatrist now who finally got me diagnosed and medicated for adhd, but I dont think the meds actually interfere with my sleep given that they've worn off 4-8 hours before I go to bed and I had these issues before being medicated, too. I'm gonna ask him about OTC sleep aides and what (if any) possible meds I could take while taking stimulant medication at my next apt, but I have a while until then but my sleep patterns are unbearable right now and I still have a while before that apt.

being on an antidepressant/SSRI/SNRI of any sort is not something I'm okay with (had emotional flatlining with each of the 10+ different kinds I've been on, as well as other negative effects + not really being depressed I dont think), and would prefer something I dont have to take daily to be effective because once quarantine ends, there will most likely be days where I cant or forget to take them.

I know there are a few lifestyle related things I could change to improve how tired I get, as my schedule was a little better before quarantine, but I'm extremely unmotivated and uncoordinated as of late and dont feel very capable of big consistent changes at the moment, but I'm still super willing to hear advice in that area for when I do feel able to try again. 

I'm really struggling to find resources on the intersection between high tolerance for sleep aides, adhd, and insomnia/sleep problems. any insight, whether it be things I could take or habits I could work on, would be greatly appreciated.



TLDR: brain wants dopamine-producing activities more than sleep because of adhd + I cant get tired at a normal time + I have a high tolerance for sleep aides + need something that is safe while also taking stimulant meds during the day. any advice?",Mirtazapine
726,"Trazadone vs Mirtazapine for sleep with anxiety First time posting here so I hope I'm not breaking any rules. My Dr has given me three options in regards to general anxiety and my difficulty with sleep. I have HBP and so I have to stay active but unfortunately working out causes muscle spasms/twitching/""vibrating"" that is giving me extreme anxiety when trying to go to sleep (doesn't bother me any other time). The first two options are trazadone or mirtazapine while the third is a consistent regimen of sertraline. I am not depressed but I do have anxiety so I am wary of just consistently taking an SSRI like sertraline so the other two options seem more appealing (take as needed). Trazadone seems safer than mirtazapine based on user reviews but I really want to get some steady sleep and would love feedback from anyone with experience.

EDIT: Baclofen is an option but my GP wants me to try a week with trazadone or mirtazapine first.",Mirtazapine
727,"Longest you've went without sleeping My insomnia began just before my 21st birthday.

Time I turned 24, I was getting between 1 and 4 hours a night on average.

Then for about a year I basically got about 30 minutes a night and went unemployed.

At 30 I went on mirtazapine and started getting about 4 hours a night.

Then at 33 I went on zopiclone with promethazine and went about 6 months getting between 6 to 8 hours a night - which was wonderful.

However, it appears I may have to discontinue them now as I ultimately developed poor responses to every psychoactive drug, and now it's happened with these also.

So;

Back to no sleeping, ever?

I have no idea.

I'm just curious, how does that feel, not to sleep, not to have the capacity to sleep ever, at all?

733,"Why does a medication suddenly stop working after only a couple of weeks? Dear fellow insomniacs,

I’ve been to the hospital (2nd time) a couple of weeks ago with heavy stress-induced insomnia. I have been given 100mg Traszodone, 15 Mirtazapine, 100 Quetiapine (plus 50mg retard) and 3.75mg Zopiclone. I know it is a lot of stuff and it scares me. But at least it put me to sleep instantly. I just could not keep my eyes open. Sleep lasted for about 4 hours, then I’d wake up and take 80mg Dominal & 3.75 Zopiclone, fell asleep again and felt fine the next morning. Yet since a couple of days the first dose, which put me to sleep so wonderfully, stopped working. I almost don’t feel a thing. I’m used to the effects of a medication wearing off longterm bur not after a couple of weeks?! Has anybody experienced this and what did they do? I think I can’t take any more Trazodone or Quetiapine... my doctor told me to tamper out Mirtazapine, which I started but I think it’s not helping clearly! He’s part of those psychs who think few nirtazapine works better, but I have adverse experience.
My next appointment is on Thursday. I don’t know how to get there, because when my sleep gets thatvad again, I’ll start feeling suicidaland I can’t have that. I really can’t. Should I make do with as many Zopiclone as it takes till Thursday?

Any answer is appreciated. Sorry for any mistakes, I’m German.

Thanks a lot!!!!!

734,"Sudden onset of insomnia Hi guys..

To make a long story short. I have always been a happy person in general sometimes a bit of anxiety here and there but nothing major that'll make me question reality.
I'm an active weed smoker and have been since the age of 17 I'm now 26 years old.
Since the lockdown began i started noticing a few symptoms which at first got me a bit worried but not a lot. Out of nowhere i started feeling weak, fatigued and started to feel internal tremors like vibrations inside my body that i couldn't see but i could feel them, it started to worry me a bit because i thought it was probably coronavirus symptoms.
My anxiety started to flare up but i could still go on about my day without any major problems.
The internal tremors started to keep me up at night so the gp prescribed me Promethazine 25mg to be taken once before bed. It worked i slept like a baby for the next two weeks. Everything started to feel normal again and i was happy.
Fast foward 1 month later and i started to have sleeping problems like waking up in the middle of the night. I told my gp and he prescribed me 25mg again for another week.
This time is didn't work i was still up during the night and started to feel as if i wasn't able to fall asleep anymore now before any of this started 1 zoot was enough to KO me for the night but now it was different not only was i not able to sleep but my mind would race with a lot of thoughts about everything.
I couldn't sleep i felt like i was going insane,  music that i has heard earlier in the day would just continue playing in my head in a loop throughout the night.
I contacted my gp again he prescribed me with zopiclone 3.5mg and on the first night it KOd me but not on the second night i was still finding it hard to go to sleep (bare in mind that i keep fit and go swimming and gym whenever i can).
Phoned the gp and this time he prescribed me Diazepam 10mg man the anxiety disappeared but i still wasn't able to sleep by this time i had probably slept 7 hours the whole week.
Called my gp again this time he prescribed me with setraline 50mg and boy that's when the suicidal thoughts and depression came, i immediately stopped taking them after only 3 days.
Called my gp again, he prescribed me with melatonin 2mg again this didn't work at all.
I was about to give up on life and was thinking of ways to put an end to my missery because a lack of sleep meant that i wasn't thinking properly and i wasn't enjoying the things i normally do.
I cried like a baby that whole week.
Called the gp again this time he prescribed me with mirtazapine and boy did i sleep like a baby on the first night on 15mg.
The next day i tried it again and slept finally but i was  still waking up during the night but i could still fall back to sleep something i couldn't do before.
I'm still struggling to sleep without waking up 4 or 5 times during the night. My mood is slightly improving but now I'm a bit irritable with my loved ones.
I have tried everything even stopped smoking weed for a week with no success. I just want my old life back where i could sleep without any medication.
I've had blood tests done and everything seems fine the doctor said I'm a healthy young man.
Please if someone is going through any depression and anxiety just remember that there is a solution to every you just have to keep looking and never let your thoughts control your life.

735,"A hello to fellow sufferers. Hello, I've had chronic insomnia for over a year now. It started last June during a case of Pericarditis, when a common cold virus inflamed the sack surrounding my heart. I recovered from that very well, but it left me with the insomnia. I've been told I'm very fit in my annual medical tests, plus I spend a lot of time outside doing a physical job. I used to be the sort of person who could fall asleep so easily, at any time of the day if I wanted, but now I'm living a wide-eyed nightmare. I'm sure many of you know the feeling well. It's making work very difficult, and the doc has suggested Mirtazapine (15mg). I'm scared to use it, since life is difficult enough without a drug dependency later on down the road, and I read that it can cause weight gain. I worked hard to lose weight many years ago, successfully.

I've tried a long list of supplements, some of which I shall continue using (like Magnesium), and many I shall abandon (Valerian root does nothing for me any more). I'm sure my loved ones are bored to tears with me and this problem, so I came here to join people who are facing a similar struggle. I am determined to overcome this.

She also ordered an insomnia test, that I have to go in for. I can't sleep without meds so I'll fail that hands down. It's during the day.

751,"Sleep deprivation induced hallucinations Hello, sorry this is so long, this is my first post here after discovering this sub, I have suffered from insomnia for around 20 years. 

This is incredibly embarrassing and distressing for me to talk about, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have seen a couple of articles online where people have had hallucinations after lack of sleep, but they seemed to be aware that they were hallucinating, and I truly, truly believed what I was seeing was real  :(

3 days ago I had been awake for 72 hours. I was convinced that there were fish swimming out from under my floor, and that there was a snake in a plastic bag in my living room. I actually took a video on my phone of this and sent it to a friend and my mother - just thinking about this makes me cringe. I actually called the police to get rid of the snake because I was so terrified, they came out and obviously no snake. I assumed it had moved elsewhere in my apartment. 

The police asked me about my mental health and then left. They then had apparently called paramedics, who checked me over and asked me the mental health screening questions like the date, year, who the prime minister is etc. I was convinced at that point that the snake was on one of the sofas in my living room, and after they left I could see it clearly - a HUGE snake, if I made a noise it would react, it was slowly opening and closing its mouth...I wasn't scared by this but wouldn't go near it. I even took more photos. I also called the RSPCA to come and get it. They did attend and as soon as they did I couldn't see the snake anymore. They searched my place and found nothing, looked at the photos and said they were not convinced that it was a snake. I was still COMPLETELY convinced at this stage, about 12 hours after I first 'saw' it.

In the meantime, my friend was incredibly worried about me and the texts I was sending her telling her about the snake. I want to smack myself in the face thinking about this now! As I work with her, she spoke with my HR contact and they had a conference call with me, concerned about my mental state. They asked permission to speak with my brother (my next of kin, my parents live abroad). My brother came over after work and searched my place again and told me that he fully believed that I was hallucinating. He told me that he had experienced it too after going several days without sleep. I still insisted it was real. My brother also insisted that I eat something as I'd gone a couple of days without food - I'm severely disabled and can't cook meals when I'm having bad days so have been eating only once a day for a while as I have to depend on meal delivery services. 

That evening I was really scared, believing that there was a snake somewhere in my home. I set up barriers of plastic bags around so I'd hear the snake moving around. Thankfully I fell asleep with the help of some sleeping pills (far too many actually- 350mg diphenhydramine, some clonazepam and mirtazapine). The next day I knew that I'd been hallucinating. I felt so so upset, embarrassed, horrified that so many people were witness to my psychosis episode. 

The paramedics had spoken to my doctor, who is incredibly good and familiar with my problems with insomnia as well as my complex medical history. She is part time though so told them to instruct me to get an emergency telephone consultation as soon as possible. I spoke to a doctor I had never seen before late the day after the hallucinations. He was absolutely horrible, was somehow convinced that I was calling to obtain Tramadol, when in fact I'd been trying to explain my recent medical history since he was unfamiliar with my case. I've been on painkillers long term for a severe back injury. He shouted at me, wouldn't let me speak, and at the end of the call told me he was going to prescribe me Amitryptaline with no explanation. I was very distressed throughout the call and for the rest of the evening in floods of tears. 

Thankfully the next day a GP I've had treatment under before called me and was very kind, she spent about 40mins discussing treatment options (the first call lasted just over 5 minutes). She had obviously read my medical records and hospital correspondence, MRI results etc. She decided that the best option for me is to begin treatment with fentanyl transdermal patches to cope with the chronic pain which contributes to my insomnia. She also explained the Amitriptyline and how it would help, and increased the amount of mirtazapine I take. We also discussed other measures that will possibly help as zopiclone doesn't work for me anymore. 

So, I'm hoping that things will improve,  but I'm still terrified of the hallucinations happening again, and still very tearful and embarrassed about what happened. Last night I began the Amitriptyline and got about 3 hours of sleep. On Monday I begin the fentanyl, and I am both glad that my pain is being taken seriously and apprehensive about taking such a strong painkiller. My brother is coming over today to help with some housework and have lunch with me, so I'm looking forward to having him to speak to. I'd really like to know how common this is though, or if my brain is completely screwed up...I'm so scared of this happening again, it was absolutely real to me, now I can't help but wonder if I can really trust anything that I see!",Mirtazapine

to those who have been struggling with something similar, care to share methods that worked for you? i tried meditating, more sleeping pills (i was on mirtazapine, risperidone, melatonin, and diphenhydramine all at once last night. they didnt seem to work), sleep hygiene. am i a lost cause? i used to sleep so easily before my illness and the pandemic. :---(",Mirtazapine

755,"I am getting better sleep There was a post a little while ago that said this board was useless because the people who cured their insomnia usually don’t post here. Personally, it’s true that since I have been sleeping a bit better, I haven’t come here, so I wanted to rectify that. Anywoo, brief synopsis of my insomnia. I’ve always been a night owl, and that was manageable for the most part. Around three years ago, I suddenly started experiencing mid-night awakenings: wake up after about 4 hours of sleep and unable to fall back asleep. It could take me up to 4 more hours to feel sleepy again. I became anxious about these early awakenings because, like everybody else, I’d heard that not getting enough sleep was bad for the health. As a result of this anxiety, I now couldn’t even fall asleep to begin with. I went to see psychologists, psychiatrists, and doctors to get this insomnia resolved, and I tried a bunch of prescription meds to help me sleep: mirtazapine, trazodone, Seroquel, gabapentin, etc. The problem with these drugs is that, eventually, I would build a tolerance to them and they wouldn’t put me to sleep. The frustrating thing for me, is that I knew part of the issue was the anxiety over sleep was making it hard to sleep, but it felt like my body had now made it a habit to get anxious at night. I tried to fix my insomnia the “natural way”, with meditation, hypnosis, CBT-I ... I tried CBT-I on two occasions and both times, I failed: I just couldn’t last a month with four hours of sleep, which is what ended up happening with sleep restriction (I had 6 hours allotted to sleep, but I still woke up after about 4 hours of sleep).
Last October, I saw a new sleep doctor. He wanted me to take Lunesta. After haggling with the insurance company for three months to pay for Lunesta, I was finally able to take it. But I was still having mid-night awakenings with Lunesta. So the sleep doctor referred me to a new psychiatrist who prescribed Lexapro because he said depression can disturb sleep, and then insomnia creates depression and it’s a vicious circle of insomnia and depression feeding each other. With the combination of Lexapro and Lunesta, I have not experienced early awakenings: I still sometimes wake up at night, but I fall right back to sleep. I would like to one day, not be dependent on drugs and to sleep like a normal person, but at least, I don’t feel like a crazy person anymore. I mean, I was so irritable and miserable during this 3 year ordeal, I felt like my “normal” personality was disappearing. So anyway, conclusion is: it took over two years to find doctors who didn’t mind prescribing separate medicine for sleep and depression, instead of trying to cure everything with just one pill. Now that I have medicine to help me sleep “normal”, I have to take another stab at CBT-i. So that’s my story so far.",Mirtazapine
756,"My story (recovering insomniac) I've never had a great relationship with sleep. Even before insomnia, I would have trouble sleeping if I was in a new place (sleepovers at friend's houses didn't work well for me). Likewise, if I had some important thing that I had to do early the next day, I could count on major trouble falling asleep. My first real brush with insomnia was ~16 years old. It lasted for about a month. It would take me 4-6 hours to fall asleep every night, and at least one night I never got to sleep at all. I never saw a doctor, and eventually it passed.

Then, about three years ago, in my early-30s, i had a major recurrence. I'd been on a late sleep schedule for a while (falling asleep between 2 and 4 a.m. and sleeping late). Long story short, something came up where I realized I had to be somewhere for something important the following day by like 7 o'clock. I tried forcing myself to go to sleep early, and the result was that I never slept at all that night, finally getting out of bed when I realized that it was close to when my alarm was going to be sounding. I figured I'd sleep good that night because I'd be so tired. But no, instead I spent another sleepless night. In the morning I decided to see a doctor, but since I couldn't get an appointment I went to the ER. Doc at the ER gave me a prescription for Ambien 5mg.

The Ambien worked like magic at first, putting me right out. Unfortunately, very quickly it started to wear off. It would put me to sleep, but I'd only sleep for 2-3 hours. I finally saw my primary doctor, and she didn't want me to stay on Ambien long-term, so she suggested I try melatonin and some OTC stuff (I think dextromethorphan). It didn't work, so she tried me out on Trazadone 50mg. That didn't work, so she switched me back to Ambien 5mg. Keep in mind that I was taking it EVERY NIGHT, as I couldn't get to sleep without it. After a while of having the same problem of falling asleep but failing to STAY asleep, she upped the dosage to 10mg. Because of a mistake on my part, I thought I was still taking 5mg, so on some nights I was actually taking two pills thinking it totalled 10mg, but in reality it was 20mg. Even then, the problems persisted.

Eventually my doc decided to get me off of Ambien altogether, and put me on Mirtazapine (I believe it was 15mg). Finally, I found something that seemed to work.  While I still failed to fall asleep unaided (my doc asked me to try to fall asleep naturally, and only take a pill when I couldn't), the pill seemed to help me get through the night.

My doc then had me see a sleep specialist. He said he didn't like people taking pills long-term, so after a sleep apnea test (I didn't have it, thankfully) he weaned my off the Mirtazapine and had me follow a sleep hygiene protocol: turn off the lights as the night got late, refrain from caffeine after 4 p.m., refrain from lying in bed unless I was going to bed, getting out of bet for a while if I was having too much trouble getting to sleep, etc. He also bad me keep a sleep diary, and set up rules where I lay down at the same time every night (11:30), and set my clock for 6 a.m. With my sleep diary, I kept track of approximately how long it took to fall asleep, and took note of any waking periods. No matter what, I had to get out of bed at 6, even if I'd barely gotten any sleep. If I was sleeping ~80% of the time I was in bed for a week straight, I could move my alarm back in 15 minute increments and repeat, 6 to 6:15 to 6:30, and so on. Eventually I started sleeping through the night without any help. Altogether, it has been 5-6 months of hell.

Since then I'll still have a bad night every now and then, and on occasion I'll have a night where I can't sleep at all. On the nights when I don't get to sleep, the next night I usually fall asleep very easily.

I did post recently about a bit more serious recurrence where I had trouble for about a week. The first night, I couldn't sleep at all, and then the following days it took me hours to fall asleep, and I could only sleep for 2-3 hours. I saw the same sleep specialist from before, but as it had only be a short period, he told me to just follow good sleep hygiene and that I should get back to normal. He was right, and I've had several days of more or less normal sleep.",Mirtazapine

b) I megadose magnesium (8-12grams, although a lot, magnesium is very safe in high doses, it primarily becomes a laxative in those ranges ... helps but not strong enough to combat rebound insomnia

759,"Insomnia related to hormones? I've always been a ""bad"" sleeper, takes me minimum of an hour to fall asleep at night, but once I get over the hurdle of falling asleep, the rest of the night goes just fine. I used to have a stretch of bad nights about every 6 weeks, which was fine, not fun but totally manageable. I wouldn't have even described that as insomnia tbh. However, I had a baby 9 months ago and since that pregnancy began, my sleep has been progressively worse. Baby's been sleeping through the night since 6 months, so that's not the issue.

&#x200B;

The first bad bout of insomnia came during first trimester of pregnancy, which isn't out of the usual. It went away after probably 2 weeks. I managed it by taking Unisom, which is safe to take during pregnancy.

&#x200B;

The second bout came when my baby started sleeping through the night. I had about 2 weeks straight of simply not being able to fall asleep. I'd be so tired that I couldn't even get up and read, because I couldn't keep my eyes open. But I'd lie in bed, so relaxed that my Fitbit watch recorded it as sleep, and just not fall asleep. I could only finally pass out around 4am or even later. I tried taking Unisom or Benadryl and neither made any difference. After 2 weeks from hell, I cut out caffeine (which I've drank in moderation my entire adult life with no side effects) and like magic, my sleep immediately went back to normal. I'm still heartbroken over giving up coffee, but if I have even a half cup, my sleep that night will be awful, so it's not worth it. I haven't gone back since.

&#x200B;

Now I'm in the middle of another bout. It's been three weeks since I've been able to fall asleep without taking medication. I had Unisom left over from my pregnancy and my routine has been: go to bed around 10pm, try to sleep, get up 11/11:30pm to take a half Unisom, fall asleep by midnight. If I ever didn't take the Unisom and just tried to push through, I'd be up until 4am or whenever I finally caved and took something. My cycle returned about a week before this bout of insomnia started...

&#x200B;

All this to say: does anyone have experience with hormone-related insomnia? It seems obviously related to me that my 3 worst bouts of insomnia have been first trimester pregnancy, baby stops breastfeeding at night, and first cycle postpartum. 

&#x200B;

I went to see a sleep specialist just yesterday since I ran out of Unisom (I bought it in the US when I was visiting over a year ago, but I don't live there and it's not sold where I live). I mentioned my theories about hormones and the specialist wasn't really interested in exploring that. He agreed it might be related and prescribed me Mirtazapin. I took it last night at just 3.75mg dose and it made me so tired - but I still lay in bed awake for 2 hours (much more tired than usual) before falling asleep around midnight. This morning, I could barely open my eyes and was very groggy all morning, which makes me think this medication might not be right for me.",Mirtazapine

It helps me sleep, sure, but it's a light sleep and I wake up a lot during the night but fall back asleep. Will it turn into a deeper sleep the longer I'm on it? I've only taken 1mg for two nights.

Insurance only covered 15 pills for 25 days. What? Is that normal? Why? Do I need to try other things before it'll be approved? Do I need to call them and make an appeal? Will I be forced to pay out of pocket for the other 15 pills? I've previously been on seroquel, mirtazapine/remeron, trazodone, temazepam, and atarax/vistaril. I have not tried ambien and I get ketamine infusions, which benzos make ineffective, so xanax, klonopin, ativan, and temazepam aren't options even though temazepam worked in the past.

What's the difference between ambien and lunesta?

I'm planning on being on this long term. My remeron dose makes me unable to sleep and my mood is doing so well on latuda and remeron (diagnosed bipolar) that we want to keep the psych meds the same and just add something for sleep.

764,"Seroquel/Quetiapine Withdrawals/Side Effects—did you experience EPS (trembling/shaking/tremor/twitching) and did it improve? Hey everyone, I’m currently 162.5mg IR Seroquel and 15mg Mirtazapine.
Stats:
1. 28 years old
2. Male 
3. 220lbs, low body fat

I was hospitalized in October for debilitating tinnitus-induced insomnia and at that time, was on 300mg Seroquel. In a month I dropped down to 250, then in another month down to 225. For all intents and purposes I basically stayed on this dose until April 1st, when I dropped down to 200mg. I am 7 1/2 months in now and just dropped to ~162.5  last night. I am dropping in 12.5mg increments. 

I’m glad I’ve been reducing the dose because around the end of March, I noticed a VERY SLIGHT tremor in my hand when using a dropper for skin care. This tremor has become more pronounced and when I lift weights my whole body feels like it’s shaking with certain exercises. When I flex my arms my hands will shake a lot, but this is completely absent at rest—only then will I get an occasional jerk/twitch of a random muscle group every four hours or so. I’ve been lifting for 12 years and have never experienced this sensation. It is incredibly upsetting and I fear that this will be a long-lasting or permanent EPS of Seroquel. So I would be stuck with a banshee in my ear and the inability to control my musculature. Awesome.

However, because of the reduction dates and timing of this symptom’s appearance, I can’t accurately say whether this is a withdrawal or a tardive side effect of quetiapine.

My questions for people who have been on seroquel: did you ever experience this trembling/twitching/shaking? Did it appear late? Did it appear during withdrawal? Did it get worse or better as you decreased? Did it dissipate?

I also have pretty constant tachycardia (~120bpm) and wake up with horrible anxiety every morning. I’m not sure if this is a side effect or part of withdrawal either.

767,"Why can't I stay asleep after waking up once? So over the last couple of weeks my sleeping experience has gone like this:

* Go to bed between 1-1:30 AM.

* Sleep until roughly 5-7 AM, at which point I will wake up to use the bathroom.

* After using the bathroom I return to bed, and am generally able to get back to sleep very quickly.

* However, after returning to bed, I will then proceed to wake up at least a dozen times between then and whenever I get out of bed for good, usually around 11 AM.

I only wake up for a few seconds, and go right back to sleep after waking up, but again, it happens a dozen times between the time I go to the bathroom and the time I ""wake up"" for real, and it usually feels like more. I'd make an attempt to log how many times this happens, but usually I'm only barely aware of it. I maintain ""dream continuity"" during this time, in that any dream I'm having when I wake up will continue where it left off once I fall back asleep; I'm not sure if that means anything. I know for sure that I am waking up, and that these interruptions are not part of any dream I may be having.

I'm really at a loss as to what to do about this. I have sent an email to my psychiatrist (currently I'm without a PCP as my former one recently relocated) to see if he has any ideas, but I figured asking here too couldn't hurt.

I'm still unable to sleep without taking medication.

She also has history (possibly) of CSA, but she cannot remember all the details. Her father was a diagnosed Psychopath (ASPD). I can attest to his diagnosis because i also have lots of traits of NPD, ASPD, hinting a genetic component, (i also have a diagnosed Cluster B personality disorder myself)

Her problem now which is affecting all areas of life is that she is waking up almost every hour. If she goes to bed at midnight she will open her eyes at 2:00 AM and will not fall asleep till 2:15 AM, she will than wake up again at 3:00 AM, than 5:00 AM, 6:30 AM, 7:00 AM, 9:00 AM, and from 9 she will toss and turn, she feels incredibly lethargic so she stays into bed till lunch.

I can see her condition is very psychological, i don't think a pill would just help, i would love to get her to do CBT but English is limited, she talks to me about this every day and has told me to try find some advice online. She saw a doctor a few weeks ago and has been on Mirtazapine, she says it has helped her mood and anxiety issues, but her sleep is still very poor.

How can i finally get my mother the life she dreams of having? the whole family is behind her on this and fixing this debilitating issue,.",Mirtazapine
781,"Journey To Recovery From Insomnia Hello all,

I am going to detail here my journey to recovery from insomnia (to keep myself accountable but also to hopefully show some people who have given up that recovery is possible no matter the severity and duration of your insomnia). Some background info on me- I have had severe chronic insomnia for the past 11 years. During my teens I would sleep between 2-3 hours per night and would sometimes go for a couple of days without sleeping at all. Nowadays, I sleep every night for around 3.5 hours total. Very rarely I might get 1-2 hours. I have tried many herbal remedies, stimulus control therapy, certain methods from CBT-I (but never all at once- which is what I plan to do now), exercise, meditation, sleeping pills, mirtazapine, olanzapine, and other methods. None have worked so far. This time, I plan to use every technique from CBT-I for a period of 12 months. The longest I have attempted CBT-I was for 3 months, to no avail. I shall also be incorporating exercise, meditation, and good nutrition into my recovery regime. I shall be eating one kiwi fruit, one glass of tart cherry juice, one handful of almonds, and a whole-wheat cracker with nut butter 1-2 hours before bed, as the evidence shows these foods improve sleep by boosting melatonin, tryptophan, and serotonin- all important factors for sleep.

I am currently on day 7 of sleep restriction therapy- my sleep window is 5 hours and 45 minutes. As my sleep diary for the past week shows, I have only been sleeping for 3.5 hours of this time. Therefore, as of tomorrow, I will be reducing my sleep window to 5 hours per night, the minimum recommended sleep window. Therefore, my bedtime will be 12:15 and wake up time will be 5:15. So far, on day 7 of sleep restriction therapy, my sleep drive before bed is quite strong. I struggle to stay awake for the last hour. I have been falling asleep in under 40 minutes which for me is huge. I still wake up after about 90 minutes and am awake for a while but I am sleeping about the same lying in bed for 5.5 hours as I would when I lay in bed for 9 hours so I have much more time in my day. One aspect of CBT-I I have not been doing is getting up out of bed if I haven't been sleeping for more than 20 minutes. I am typically too tired at night to bother doing this. I feel like if I am going to give recovery my all, however, I have to use this technique. Hopefully tomorrow night I will start doing this. However, for now, my main focus is to summon the willpower to get out of bed at 5:15am. I feel reasonably good today- even though I am tired I am awake and in a good mood. Anyway, I hope this thread can provide hope for people in 12 months time from now and can keep me accountable in the mean time. All the best. I will post weekly updates.

**Day 14**

Boy, am I tired. This sleep restriction therapy is tough. Still using a sleep window of 5 hours 45 minutes but now that a week has passed and my sleep efficiency is well below 85% (getting about 3-3.5 hours per night), I must reduce my sleep window by 15 minutes to 5.5 hours. This is going to be hard. I really struggle to stay awake until my bed time so going to bed 15 minutes later will be rough. I'm proud of myself so far though. I have gone to bed at 12:15 every night and gotten up at 6:00am every morning. My sleep pressure is quite strong before bed and I'm happy to say that for the first time in years, I'm falling asleep within 30 minutes. Unfortunately, I still wake up quite frequently throughout the night and take along time to fall back asleep, if I even fall back asleep. The one thing I have not been doing is getting out of bed if I can't sleep for more than 30 minutes. I've just been wanting to introduce one technique at a time and wanted to stick to just sleep restriction therapy now. I think tonight will be the night that I'll finally start getting up if I'm too awake in bed (I won't look at the clock to monitor though) but I know this is going to be tough. CBT-I is almost like torture. But then again so is insomnia and if I want to get over this I have to put up with some initial sleep deprivation I suppose. I hope it starts to get better within a couple of weeks :/",Mirtazapine

There’s none in it!

The other one is the same but I put a pack of bacon in for the stock! And a wee cheeky dash of Worcestershire sauce!

One gets parsley and chilli as garnish.....

The other gets toasted cheese/crusty bread floating on top sprinkled with chilli....

The real test is actual users on reddit however. Have any of you noticed long term improvements, like do you feel it helped to upregulate gaba receptors? Or is it BS?

785,"how to cycle chronic insomnia meds like a pro I tried sobriety and I'm done with a year of 2 hour average nightly sleep which forced me to this forum.

So fuck it, I'm going back to what I did before and live a happy productive life:

Sunday night: weekend is over and I know I need to be fresh. Hit the xans. 1 to 2mg supplemented by trazadone as necessary. 8 hours sleep. 

Monday night: Gaba A receptors need a rest. Hit the mary Jane. Indica is best. Supplement with beer so I don't fly off into active brain land high. 6 to 8 hours sleep.

Tuesday Night: Get an early night. Blast my brain with mirtazapine at 8pm. Make sure to have coffee ready for the morn. 8 to 10 hour sleep.

Wednesday night: Time to give my opioid receptors a treat and take the edge off midweek. Crack out the Kratom. Start early evening until I drift away.....6 hour sleep

Thursday night: nearly end of week. I could have another mirtazapine or maybe I will give my gaba b receptors a work out with some phenibut. Or if I REALLY want to sleep, some seroquel. 8 hours sleep.

Friday night: Yes, I made it through another work week,a productive member of society. I will TAKE ABSOLUTELY nothing tonight, Maybe I will go out and all will be amazed at my energy and ability to keep going to the early morning (and beyond). Or maybe I will write a novel. 

Saturday night: Maybe I did or maybe I didn't get sleep last night. No worries, today is a fasting day. I am starving my brain until it gives up and craves for sleep. About 11pm I will give it a light snack so I don't get fasting insomnia. As the blood rushes to my stomach I can feel my body give way and.....3 to 6 hours sleep.

Sunday: repeat cycle.

786,"Nightmares EVERY day... &#x200B;

EDIT : I **don't qualify** for PTSD. Sure I've been through some stressful times, but nothing like that. The dreams are mostly absurd and not related to past events. Think of dreams with monsters, etc...

&#x200B;

Just to give some background, I've been taking Mirtazapine for sleep for about 2 years, about 1.5 of which were on 15mg. For 3 months however, I've been on just 7.5mg, in an attempt to slowly taper off of the med, as its effectiveness for sleep was practically gone and I wasn't depressed.  The jump from 15mg to 7.5mg wasn't that hard.

For the past month, incidentally the month with the most days without sunlight here in Belgium,  I have been having nightmares EACH night. They usually occur in my third sleep cycle and onward. I'll get 4 hours of ok sleep, at most 6 but very rarely so, then I'll wake up. Mind you that I can fall back asleep in 5-15 mins each time, which makes it all the more weirder. The next dreams, holy shit, are ALWAYS nightmares, in increments of 1-2 hours of sleep each.

The only thing I've currently find to combat them well... are benzos, but I take them on and off because most of us here know what happens with long-term daily use. I remember some calming tea with Camomilla, Holy Basil, Gember, ... being effective. But these kind of teas make me have to go pee in the middle of the night, accompanied by extreme dry mouth and dehydration, keeping me up for the rest of the night and defeating the purpose really.

Anyone experience with what seems to be a Nightmare Disorder, more specifically in relation to Mirtazapine ( Remeron )? Mind you, I don't really wake up screaming, it just leaves me feeling uncomfortable in the morning and before bed, and of course there's the sluggishness from impaired sleep.

TLDR : Taking Mirtazapine ( Remeron ) 7.5mg. Extremely heavy dominating REM-sleep, similar to that found in PTSD patients. However, I don't qualify for PTSD at all. Nightmares in later parts of the night, leading to interrupted sleep. only awake for 5-15 mins between each interrupted part.

789,"Need help with CBD for severe insomnia I've had trouble with insomnia and depression all my life and have taken Mirtazapine and Seroquel for a couple of years. Last year I started to reduce my dosage of Seroquel slowly and the insomnia started right away. But I managed and finally stopped taking any since May. Only problem is that I probably really f-ed up my brain chemistry with these drugs and I really can't get any sleep naturally anymore. I really thought my brain would heal with time and would let me return to a normal sleep pattern and 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep eventually. But no such luck. I'm usually awake all night and if I manage to fall asleep it is only for 2-3 hours and I'm awake again for hours.

I've tried everything from Valerian to Melatonin, Magnesium and 2-3 glasses of red wine before sleep. Currently only 1/2-1 tablet of Benadryl helps, but also only for 3 hours max. I still try Melatonin in various dosages from 3-10mg every night because I hope my body will be tired eventually and it will help. I first try the Melatonin and Magnesium but usually have to get back to the Benadryl when I'm just too exhausted.

So I had a lot of hope for CBD to help with my insomnia. I have to add that I'm in Europe so my options to try different strains, brands or a dispensary are very limited or non-existent. I ordered CBD from a Dutch company where I also order the Melatonin (also not legal in my country in higher dosage), it is called Lucovitaal and a huge company that sells all kinds of food supplements all over NL so I think their products are not placebos and have the advertised mgs. I got 90 capsules with 10mg per capsule and CBD oil with 5% and 2mg CBD per drop.

I first started with 1 capsule (10mg) an hour before I wanted to go to bed and it did not calm me down or made me tired at all. Instead it felt that my mind was racing and I could not sleep at all. I tried a couple more times with 10mg then 20mg but I still can't fall asleep and I definitely don't feel relaxed or anything at all. I also tried the oil. Some drops during the day and 10 at night (20mg) which also didnt help.

I heard CBD helped so many people with their insomnia (falling asleep and sleeping through the night) and I'm really desperate for anything to help me. What am I doing wrong? Why doesn't it help me? Is it the wrong dosage? There is also a Polish company called Cannabigold that I could try but this Lucovitaal company is well established in the Netherlands and does not seem to sell fraudulent products.

Any advice from people who deal with insomnia and CBD?",Mirtazapine
790,"Mirtazapine was working.... now it's not. Help/advice very much needed. Was prescribed mirtazapine a few months ago after dealing with insomnia for years and it initially worked great. The first couple nights I took 7.5mg which didn't do its job then bumped it up to 15 which was a little better but not the same until I finally settled at 30mg.... now, a few months later, 30 is no longer doing anything as I am right back in the hell I was in before getting the prescription. 

&#x200B;

Is this just a case of building a tolerance? Should I take 45mg? Should I go back down to 7.5mg or 15mg and see if that helps? Am I going to need to go back to my Doctor to get something stronger?

Unmedicated I will usually run over night with no sleep, even though I lay in bed 10 hours a night, completely still and eyes closed. Nice bed, cold room, black out curtain, fan on. And when I do sleep I get a half hour to 1.5 hours and that's it, once I wake there's no chance of falling back asleep until the next night, and even then I may be up over night and this never lets up. And yes,  im totally miserable and struggling to maintain my life. Xanax or temazepan works great, take it at night and wake up 5 or 6 hours later with all the energy in the world until the end of the night the next night. The doc won't prescribe it for me again because it isn't considered a long term solution. We settled with mirtazipine, an anti depressant. Seems to put me to sleep for 4 hours, wake up and take a piss and I fall back asleep for 2 or 3 more hours. Problem is, I wake up still not wanting to get out of bed and have no energy. Not like when I take temazepam or xanax. Anyways when I'm relaxing before bed I notice the heart murmurs that I can predict and during the day I have heavy hand feet and armpit sweat, it comes in waves even when I'm just sitting down. Any one wants to talk about symptoms or whatever let's talk.

I briefly took Lexapro once, and it did improve my mood, but it felt weird feeling “happy” despite being exhausted from lack of sleep. Again, I know I should see a doctor for these medicine questions, it’s just that after 2 years of seeing doctors to get treatment, I sort of feel like most of them are just shooting darts at a board to see what sticks.

797,"Need ideas on what is wrong with me TL:DR-I wake up 10x an hour and no doc knows why. Looking for suggestions as to the cause. 

I'm a 24 yo female. I've been dealing with insomnia for about 8 years. A year ago I finally went to my PCP to discuss finding a solution. 

I tried mirtazapine and trazodone, which knock me out pretty quickly but don't keep me asleep through the night. The mirtazapine also affects my mood. 
Next he sent me to an ENT as I have a deviated septum, but after 2 months of trying a nasal spray to see if opening the airway more would help (it didn't), the ENT then sent me to a sleep doc. 

The sleep doc was super concerned that I have a history of occasional sleep walking/talking. He also noted I have a slight heart murmur. I had my first study done, which revealed that my breathing is normal with no snoring, but I wake up 10x an hour. He thought it was because my tongue falls to the back of my mouth, but this doesn't make sense to me as I normally sleep on my side or belly. 

I asked my PCP to recommend me to another sleep specialist. This one also noted my heart murmur, septum, and that I have a large tongue and tonsils. But again the second study showed no breathing issues and waking 10x an hour. She did not think it was because of my tongue. She also didn't want to prescribe me any meds and told me to have my thyroid tested. 

Also had an echocardiogram and the murmur I have is fairly common.

So now I have seen an endocrinologist and all tests are normal (I did a blood draw and a 24 hour urine test). 

I've also consulted with my obgyn, because the sleep issues seem to line up about the time I started taking birth control to relieve PCOS symptoms. As of right now, I'm on keto trying to lose weight so that I can hopefully try going off of the BC for about 3 months to see if I have an improvement in sleep. I'm worried though because without BC my cycle is crippling. 

After a year of being bounced around from doc to doc, it's an understatement to say I'm frustrated. It blows my mind to think that this is so uncommon that they literally have no idea where to look next. 

So I'm hoping to find someone in this subreddit who may be experiencing what I am and could help point me in another direction.

I have struggled with always being tired after starting Paxil in 8th grade. The one good news about this was that I could almost always sleep. Naps were a favorite of mine. Over the past few years, things have changed a bit. Napping almost always leads to a bad night of sleep... lots of tossing and turning, perhaps no sleep at all.

For the past year, I haven't felt quite like myself. Couldn't do a full 8 hours of work. Fatigued more than usual. My doctors couldn't find anything wrong until I got a new PCP. She found my vitamin D was low. As soon as I started supplementing the vitamin D, I started getting muscle spasms/twitches/jerks. These happen throughout the day and are disconcerting and annoying.

Recently, I have really been struggling with my sleep. I did a 3 night sleep study at home. No OSA found. I was diagnosed with insomnia with dyssomnia. I barely got any stage N3 sleep because anytime I hit this stage, I started to bounce back and forth between stage N2 and stage N3. At least I am getting REM sleep...

Now, in the past month, I am going on full insomnia cycles. Struggle to sleep for a few nights (maybe 1-5 hours over a span of 3 days), then back to my ""regular"" sleep. I fear that this is all connected. Lack of good sleep means my body is revolting with muscle twitches/spasms/jerks and fatigue. Not to mention my anxiety has been through the roof this year: marriage problems (fighting and talk of divorce), work stress, health stress, my uncle dying from a heart attack, and all of the general worry I have carried around with me since I was a child.

I fear I am going to die from this. I am terrified that I will continue to get worse. I read the posts on here and it gives me a bit of relief, but I suppose I worry because that's all I know how to do. I want to watch my kids grow up and be there for them. Not die because I can't get sleep... Tonight was really hard for me. I got Clonazepam from my psychiatrist and that used to knock me on my ass (9+ years ago) for the anxiety I would struggle with. I couldn't keep my eyes open, even with splitting the pill in half. Tonight? Full dose. Nothing. I took it 2 hours ago and I am wide away at my computer.

Perhaps you all can provide some reassurance for me. My doctors don't know what to do at this stage. They've provided Doxepin, gabapentin, and now clonazepam. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. I had a brain MRI for some vision changes (static field of vision, eye sensitivity) and the muscle spasming but that came back clean. My next stop is getting an EMG nerve test to see why I'm jerking/twitching/spasming, but that's in mid-February.

Any thoughts?",Doxepin
808,"Nothing works, is there anything else I could try? I've had insomnia pretty much my entire life and have been on pretty much everything over the counter and a bunch of different prescriptions too but everything stops working after a month or two. Now my doctor has hit a wall on what to do with me because she can't prescribe anything like ambien because I take hydrocodone for chronic pain. I'm afraid at this point I will either have to choose to treat my pain or my insomnia. 

Here's a list of medications I've already been on that have all failed that I can remember off the top of my head. I'm sure there's more but it's hard to keep track of all the medications. 

Over the counter : melatonin, anything that's a sleep aid, magnesium, and night time cold medicine (I was desperate for sleep)

Prescription : nortriptylin, mirtazapine, sonata, trazadone, doxepin, quetiapine",Doxepin
809,"Disorder unknown Hey everyone, first time posting here!

So I mentioned to my psychiatrist a few months ago that I have some type of sleep disorder. I explained it to her, which completely flabbergasted her. She sent me to a sleep clinic, where I was told that my condition has yet to be identified.
Sleep clinic didn't even perform a sleep study on me, as they said it wouldn't diagnose anything.

The disorder is like this: I'll go to bed at let's say midnight exactly. In exactly 3 hours, I will wake up completely and be very wired.
Let's say I go to bed at 10pm, I will then proceed to wake up at 1am exactly. It's always exactly 3 hours.

Now it didn't start this way, this disorder suddenly occurred during the summer of 2019 and I got exactly 5 hours of sleep each night with no exceptions. 
About 12 months ago from today, it shortened to just 4 hours each night.
These last few months are where I'm at now with my current allowance of 3 hours per night.
As you can see, this condition is progressively getting worse.

Along with this sudden onset disorder during 2019, I also developed severe hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). I also lost the ability to regulate my body temperature appropriately.
When I get a little warm, my body quickly ramps up heat until I'm melting and begin profusely sweating.
It's very rare I get too cold, but when it happens I violently shake/shiver. Typically I'll walk around in the dead of winter with nothing more than a t-shirt....and I'll begin sweating.....even in below freezing temps.

So my psychiatrist of course thought she could help me with the sleeping aspect of this condition. She has prescribed me a bunch of different sleep aids.

I've been on all of these without success:
-Seroquel, -Remeron, -Lunesta, -Clondine, -Clonazepam, -Doxepin, -Risperidone.

Nothing works to extend sleep beyond 3 hours.
I fall asleep very easily.
I eat incredibly healthy + I'm highly active.
I don't drink or do recreational drugs.
I practice great sleep hygiene.

So I got to thinking about my situation today, been dealing with this for over 2.5 years now.
I remembered reading up on some medical literature years ago about a condition called 
""Fatal familial insomnia"".
I looked into it today and I have most of the symptoms. No I'm not a hypochondriac.

It's an incredibly rare, terminal genetic disorder. It affects fewer than 40 families around the world. There are some cases which emerge in random people with no family history of this condition. (Yes, it runs in families). 
This condition causes progressively worsening insomnia, which eventually leads to a permanent inability to fall asleep. This inability to sleep leads to dementia, coma and death. No cure, no treatments.

So what do you all think? I am not asking for medical advice, but what is your opinion on my issue?
Does it sound like something else?
I mentioned my concern to my psychiatrist in an email today, she has yet to respond.
Diagnosis is either difficult or impossible for this disorder, as a confirmation is done post-mortem.",Doxepin
810,"Remeron/Mirtazapine question Not my typical shitpost on this account.  Just at the end of my rope really.  I've struggled with insomnia my whole life, been off and on meds throughout the years, have an official diagnosis, but still am having problems.  This year my insomnia has become the worst it's ever been.  This has also been the most stressful year to date.  I've been sick since February and have been diagnosed with IBS, still getting it fully under control.  Realized I'm likely on the spectrum and am on a waitlist for testing.  Almost lost my condo and was forced to sell and come clean to everyone in my life about financial difficulties (since resolved through sale of the condo, even bought a house to live in).  My sleep disturbances have gotten significantly worse throughout all of this, and we're on medication 5 to try and get this under control.  So far I'm not happy with it.  


So far, we've tried Trazodone, Lunesta, Nortriptyline, Doxepin, and now we're on Remeron/Mirtazapine.  It's not helping me sleep at all.  I wake up feeling tired and unmotivated (GP just increased me from 15mg to 30mg on the Remeron to help with this), and even with my ADHD medications I'm starting to have issues concentrating at work again.  I have no motivation to do anything, I haven't been able to unpack boxes sitting in my garage for the last month even though they annoy me.    I sleep maybe 3-4 hours a night, I fall asleep around 4am and wake up at 6:30am and if I can fall back asleep I wake up around 9:30 - 10am.  I have immense trouble getting out of bed.  My GP is convinced this is all related to anxiety, and that with the right dosage of Remeron that this will all go away.  While my anxiety is less than it was it's still there.   I feel like a shell of the person I used to be.  I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything really other than apathy.   GP says I need to stick this out and since we've seen ""some improvement even if I can't see it"" and once my brain chemistry balances out I'll be better, but I just feel like I'm getting worse / am not myself.  At this point the only thing that's keeping me sane at night is dabs and watching Star Trek.   Is this normal for Remeron or do I need to request a new medication?

811,"Maintenance Insomnia I’m currently at my breaking point, I have been experiencing maintenance insomnia for the past 6 months. The insomnia has been consistent and without any breaks. A normal night of sleep for me looks like this: fall asleep very easily by 11-12pm wake up around 1-2 cannot fall back asleep until around 5 am and then wake up at 7 am.

In july of 2007 is when it started.  I was working at a difficult job with a really unfriendly and gossipy bunch of young woman. I did one over night shift. I don't think that did it. I think it was the stress of the job/the environment/my life circumstances/family issues/unresolved trauma that caused it. I was unable to sleep I would have a racing heart and go into a total panic. I would go weeks without sleep, I started to hallucinate, I  was so anxious I would shake.I felt completely unhinged. I went to a sleep study and they found I have ""hyper arousals"" thorough out the night. The results did show I reach REM, but i clearly remember no sleeping tossing and turning and going into my usual panic.  I tried melatonin, i tried z quil, i tried herbals, I tried CBD, then I turned to prescriptions, ambien, lunesta, trazadone. nothing helped. I felt hopeless and on the verge of suicide, I wrote a suicide noted, I made a plan, I threw out my belongings. I went to a Psych he said why dont you try seroquel. i did and IT WORKED. but I gained so much weight, my knees hurt, my bladder was weak, and my blood sugar and cholesterol skyrocketed. But i made me sleep. I finally got a real job because I could sleep now. I felt so relieved. but now Im considered obese and my cholesterol is sky high my dr said i have to go off it. I weaned off slowly, now im on 12.5mg and i also started gabapentin 300mg and doxepin 10mg. for 3 days i tried no seroquel but I could not sleep whatsoever tossed and turned. no what? will I be stuck on this forever. has anyone had any luck going off seroquel?",Doxepin

818,"Low dose Mirtazapine or low dose Trazodone for better sleep? A couple months back my normally fragile, but okay, sleep started getting worse and worse, and I started spiraling into a dark depressive episode.

I think it might have been caused by the high dose inositol regimen ~18-24 grams per day that I had been taking over the summer to try and treat my PSSD (Post SSRI Sexual Dysfunction). I think the high dose of inositol messed something up, because my sleep has been wrecked, and I’m now an anxious and depressed mess most of the day.

Previously, I just lived with a constant low grade depression in the background, largely due to my PSSD.

Anywho, I’m at the point where I am desperate for sleep. Usually falling asleep isn’t the problem, but my sleep is very broken, and I’m usually wide awake by 4-4:30am and feel very wired.

I already take melatonin, the OTC antihistamines aren’t very helpful, I’ve tried hydroxyzine and low dose doxepin to no avail. Those latter two seemed to make things actually worse, as in made it impossible to fall asleep. Ambien is so so, but I don’t want to become dependent.

All of those I noted above have helped for sleep except that it increases my tinnitus and bruxism the next day. 

The only thing that has worked is clonazepam or benzos, but of course, I do not take them daily as there would be massive tolerance build up and dependancy. I will have to avoid anything benzo or GABA related for the time being-- so ambien wouldnt work for me atm.

This is a serious question. I really need some advice.

824,"Severe insomnia for 6 months. Worried of Fatal insomnia due to Family mutation of similarity I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. Don’t expect a response, but would appreciate any input. Bored in bed and might as well write this out.

For 6 months I have averaged about 2-3 hours of sleep per night. The most I have got is 5 hours in one night or in a 24 hour period. I can never sleep more then an hour straight. I have always struggled with sleep, but these last 6 months has taken a turn for the worst. I suffer from muscle twitching and when I do sleep, I dream right away and awake within an hour. The first 3 months, I tried OTC meds and various methods commonly used with no help. I then sought help from a sleep doctor who put me on trazodone. I have been on that for 3 months, and it has not helped. I am now on Doxepin. Picking up the meds tomorrow.

As you can imagine, the sleep deprivation has caused tremendous harm. Cognitive decline, mental breakdowns, etc. 

Well I have a genetic mutation called C9orf72 which causes ALS and dementia. I have posted here before with reassurance I do not have SFI or FFi but I am still at odds. My mutation is very close with SFI as it causes neuro degeneration and although I am no expert, there may be a correlation. I have read some medical papers and very similar. 

My insomnia has gotten progressively worse and I also have muscle spasms/twitching. I am currently on day 3 of no sleep Aside from a 30 minute rest. I went to the hospital after having no sleep for a long period and was sent home after vitals were good and heart was good. Really a waste of time sadly.

I think I've finally reached the end of the road with my current meds.  I'm on Temazepam 30mg and have been taking it for about a year and a half now.  Out of the 7 different prescription meds I've taken, this one was the best.  But now I can take a handful and it doesn't do a thing.

833,"My recent effective cure to insomnia I recently had a bout of pretty bad insomnia (no sleep at all the whole night for a week), went to the doctor get Doxepin for 3 nights, didn't help at all; went to another doctor get Dayvigo (10 mg), the first two nights, no effect at all, then it started to work since the third night and I was able to sleep during the night with not so good quality and 2-3 times of waking up during the night. The prescription lasted for a month, now not more pills.

During the time, I found a method which is quite effective on getting myself into sleep with much improved sleep quality. Although I still wake up mid-night, I can use this method to get back to sleep quickly and soundly.

The method is belly massage + ankle rotation. One thing about this method is that you will focus on working your belly and ankles so it calms down your mind.

Belly massage: lie down on bed straight, put your hands on your belly, push from chest all the way down, repeat. The key of belly massage is to find the spots that are either sore or like a knot or slushing with water, then work on these spots. During the massage, you may yawn, fart, or burp. This helps the circulation (I feel my legs to toes are getting warm). I do this for about 5-10 minutes.

Ankle rotation: after a thorough belly massage, once I start to rotate my ankles, the circular motion of the feet works like hypnotizing myself. After a couple hundreds of rotations, I can quickly fall asleep.

When I wake up mid-night, I just don't hope that I can fall back to sleep naturally. I will start the belly massage + ankle rotation routine right away, then I can go back to sleep.

Now with this method, I can sleep early at night, without any struggling, and get up early.

I posted here last year about a method curing my long term insomnia, it's called single leg standing with closed eyes. I stopped doing that since I was getting lazy during the lockdown. And due to a lot of stresses and poor sleep hygiene, the insomnia came back. I started to do the single leg standing with closed eyes everyday again. This exercise is good to improve health.

My favorite posts to read are the success stories but for a while I thought they were BS and they pissed me off and I felt forever broken. I’m happy to say I’ve slept three nights in a row on melatonin alone (okay and a little indica an hour before bed). 

In January I got covid. As much as it sucked, I could sleep finally. It makes you so tired your body doesn’t have a choice and I couldn’t believe I was thankful for this side effect. After recovering I decided this would be the year I sleep g’dammit!!

First, after an NP gave me doxepin and that backfired (kept me more awake than ever) she said she couldn’t help me anymore and said I should see a neurologist. I politely ignored that and headed to a therapist specializing in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). We worked on re framing my thoughts and how to ease stress before sleeping…but it didn’t help much, yet. I do think it’s healthy groundwork and I still meet with them 1-2x month. 

Therapist suggested I talk with a psychiatrist. I met with them and we talked about anti depressants and sleep medications. I was reluctant to try Lexapro at first so we started with a variety of sleep meds: Ambien, Gabapentin, and Neurontin.  I could write an entire blog on my experience with these bloody pills. But once we figured out dosage and I started lexapro (beginning of that was an uphill battle alone) I was sleeping. Every night, knocked out. 

Downside was now waking up became harder. No amount of coffee would make me feel fully awake. One weekend I attempted 3 nights without sleep meds and didn’t sleep at all. Back to the pills. 

I gave myself a week and tried this past weekend — only taking 5 mg melatonin before bed and it’s been successful. Some factors:

I try to work out, ride my bike, at least an hour a day. 
I stop looking at my phone hours before bed now (actually really enjoying that part.)
I smoke a wee bit of indica 1.5-2 hrs before bed. 5 mg melatonin hour before bed. 


I hope this helps someone going thru this. I’ve been a bad sleeper for 15 years. The process above took around 6 months. You find what works!

At this point my sex drive is close to non existent and I don’t know what to do. Obviously the sleep is priority as well as keeping my anxiety at bay during the day. But it’s extremely frustrating.

So I'm on day two of it, and after taking it, I swear it's making my insomnia worse.  I lay awake until well past midnight, and when I do finally get to sleep, I don't have any dreams.  The first day I used it I went to work, and for the first 3 hours I felt like I was in a dream and nothing felt real and I was exhausted.  I drank twice the caffeine I normally drink too.  It wore off eventually.  Second dose, last night, same thing, wide awake for hours, no dreams, when I woke up I had to call out of work, and I slept for 5 more hours, and still feel like shit.  

Do I keep pushing through or is that enough to call it quits? Because I feel like I'm going to lose my job if I keep trying this medicine.",Doxepin
841,"14 years of insomnia My story:

When I was in my twenties I had some insomnia. It made me upset and incredibly frustrated. It went away for a while. I moved into a new home and was planning my marriage. The insomnia returned with a vengeance.

I tried Seroquel, Trazadone, going into the er after not sleeping for a couple days. Er did nothing for me.I also tried Ambien which made me puke every time I took it. It was such a painful time for me and my fiancée didn’t know what to do with me.

Eventually my doctor put me on citalopram which helped me so much.

I slept well and I took it for seven years.

Last year I decided that I wanted off of it since I wasn’t liking the way it made me feel anymore. It went well for a while. Then it didn’t. So I was prescribed doxepin which did nothing.

The insomnia got worse since February. I couldn’t sleep for hours, heart was beating fast which made me go to the bathroom every few minutes which was annoying.

Then it was not sleeping, then getting up in the middle of the night and not getting back to sleep.

Unfortunately I am now back on the citalopram, taking a half dose. Also taking melatonin.

I was and am trying lorazepam and tizanidine.

Been sleeping well for the past few nights.

Also been taking Azo bladder control which really helps with staying up and going to the bathroom all night

My mom has sleeping problems as well.

842,"Insomnia worse, 1st week on Lexapro 😣 I decided to confront my insomnia after 15 years of suffering and never knew it would be this hard. Breaking the cycle of not sleeping is a battle (who knew. I thought my body would welcome it all). So. I sought advice from an NP, therapist and finally a psychiatrist. 

Ambien, didn’t work. Still woke up at 3 am. Gabapentin worked for a few nights then didn’t. doxepin gave me the opposite effect of feeling tired. Melatonin. nothing. 

My next resort was a medical marijuana ID. Sadly anxiety and insomnia doesn’t qualify in my state. 

I finally caved in and am trying an anti depressant. I’ve been on Lexapro for 3 days and I haven’t slept since I started it. I hope this is worth it and I can report back here in a few months a happier, less tired me. Whoever that is.

843,"Starting a new sleep med regimen while waiting for my sleep study so I don’t beat my boyfriend in my sleep. In addition to having lifelong insomnia, I’ve always had problems with nightmares and night terrors. I’ve gone through periods where I’ve slept walked. I regularly talk and scream in my sleep. I also twitch....a lot. It seems like I’m not getting the proper paralytic effects of REM sleep, or not getting proper REM sleep in general. I’m also an epileptic, so we have to rule out nighttime seizures.

But, I recently had something pretty traumatic happen, which turned my already bad anxiety up to eleven, and it’s coming out in my sleep. I’ve been violently twitching and thrashing, essentially beating my boyfriend, and keeping or waking him up so much that we haven’t been able to sleep in the same bed. And insurance sucks, so while my neurologist is appealing their initial rejection, he started treating the symptoms. In addition to prazosin for nightmares and doxepin for general insomnia, he  has added 2mg klonopin, along with melatonin. 
The next morning I woke up with my boyfriend next to me, and I was so happy I nearly cried. The movement has apparently calmed down a lot. The klonopin doesn’t do shit for my anxiety, though, so my old friend xanax stays for during the day. I also recently started strattera for ADHD, which knocks me the fuck out as well.

Sleep medication I've taken: Melatonin, valerian root, ambien, ativan, Temazepam, lunesta, Zaleplon, Trazodone, Restoril, 
Doxepin, anything over the counter.  I think that's all. With the exception of Temazepam and Melatonin, the meds have given me either adverse side effects or absolutely no relief at all.

Currently taking: 1 30mg Temazepam per night

Current issues: Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, multiple nights per week without any sleep, restless leg.

I have a dark room, big bed, comfy pillow, cold.  I stop screens at an hour before bed.  I only use the bed for sleep and sex.  I don't watch tv in bed.

I do all of this because it's easier to get it all out up front.  Anyways, I post because I want to receive some guidance on my next journey.  I've been dealing with the same sleep doctor for many years now and he's done a great job at helping me.  But this past visit on Thursday we basically reached the end of the road.  He told me that he really is out of options and he is not sure what to do next.

So I'm now wondering what should I do next.  I'm currently dealing with the worst stretch of insomnia I've ever deal with in my life over the last three weeks.

I first dealt with this horrible sleep tissue a year back, I begged for trazadone and up until now, it has been a miracle cure for me 95% of the time ... 7 hours of high quality uninterrupted sleep. No worries.

For the past 5 days, I've been suddenly waking up after 4.5-5.5 hrs like clockwork, no matter what time I go to bed and how tired I am the night before. I'm not one of those genetic rarities that function on <6 hrs of sleep. In fact, it totally cripples me. Whether it is 3 hrs or 5 hrs, my head becomes foggy to the point where I don't want to/can't study and read or do anything productive, and even moving becomes a chore.  Not sure why this started happening. Nothing traumatic happened in my life. The only thing I've been doing different is I'm consistently taking 325mg of iron sulphate at night to treat my iron deficiency. If anything, my sleep should be improving as I'm repleting my iron stores. Seems like the trazadone just stopped working.

I feel I'm doing everything right sleep-hygiene wise. My room is always quiet, dark, and comfortably cold. I think happy thoughts before I go to bed. I don't consume caffeine (only 2 pieces of dark chocolate with breakfast). 

Fearing that this will continue, I feel like I should switch to doxepin or maybe even update to mirtzapine.

My particular flavor of insomnia affects my ability to stay asleep. I have no problem initially falling asleep, and actually often fall asleep comically fast after getting into bed (just a few minutes is often enough). 
My problem is that I very frequently wake up 3-4 hours after falling asleep with the brain in overdrive, trying to solve work/life problems over and over. I’m fully aware of it when it’s happening, but can’t consciously stop it. It’s even more maddening that these problems are sometimes incredibly trivial and not worth losing sleep over, but despite my best efforts my brain seems stuck in that loop. When this is happening, I typically am unable to fall back asleep and just toss and turn for hours. The only way I found to alleviate this is by getting out of bed and going to sleep in a completely different room on a couch. Trying to go back in my bedroom puts my brain back in that overdrive mode and just doesn’t work.

My GP put me on doxepin 10 mg a night while continuing to take Wellbutrin 75 mg every morning. My question is how did doxepin work for you and how long did it take to work? I’ve read it’s immediate but I after taking it last night, it took a couple hours to really fall asleep and I must have woken up 10-15 times throughout the night that I can remember. I’m desperate to sleep well but can’t keep taking Xanax to knock me out. Thank you!! 

Sidenote: I feel like Prozac was really the only antidepressant that I could tolerate while also still sleeping well with no problems. That will be my next step I believe. Thoughts?",Doxepin
877,"The ONLY thing that worked after DECADES of trying everything was Klonopin, even though I’m scared of benzos. I love when people post the secret trick that finally really worked. If you are here, it means you’re interested in getting better — so most of us understand the importance of basic sleep hygiene (maintaining regular sleep schedule, refraining from screens and caffeine after a certain hour, having a night ritual, eating an early dinner,
Blah blah blah). We might be on multiple supplements (melatonin, magnesium, L5HTP, Valerian, passion flowe, sleepy time teas). We might meditate, and exercise early in the day, and etc.  If I did all of these things perfect it would often  help (and how easy is it really to do all that ritual perfectly every single day??) but I also might still be up all night (and I mean falling asleep for about an hour around 6 AM getting up for work at 7 — so really nearly all night.) I’ve struggled with this since since I was an my teens.

Nothing was really working...  even Tylenol pm or Benadryl or unison didn’t work. I started working with a psychiatrist on it a few years ago. He prescribed me lots of different kinds of medication, including doxepin, a new drug for non-24 hour disorder that I can’t remember the name of, and sonata (which is basically like ambien-light. Not only did it NOT work but I had a rare and extreme reaction to it with hallucinations and blackouts and the whole bit so full flavor ambient was off the table). Oh I also tried CBT-I which actually I do kind of recommend but it was just too hard to maintain for my specific lifestyle.

Anyway, the only thing that has ever worked was illegally obtained Xanax. I told that to my doc and he prescribed me Klonopin. Wow. I finally can get a full nights sleep. I sleep 7 hours even — which is basically unheard of for me — and soundly, without constantly waking up. It’s a miracle and completely a life changer. 

The problem is I knew that Xanax was the only thing that worked for a long time, but I struggled with ever using it or asking for something similar because I am terrified of benzos. I’ve seen so many friends fall down the rabbit hole. I’ve seen people actually lose their lives to their addictions to it. I know that addicitions do run in my family as well. So far I have faith in myself and I’ve used it only as directed, and not even every night. 

Some people really need benzodiazepines, because of anxiety ruining their lives (I would never let someone tell me I should stop taking my antidepressants, for example, because depression can be a fatal condition.) Everyone is different and I have no judgement for people who take this medicine and need it. However, I can’t help being a lil afraid of that class of medicines. Anyone else agree? If you do use them regularly, any thoughts or tips on staying healthy about it? I feel like I’ve just seen too many people lose themselves in it or at least become dependent/addicted, and so the thought of having thirty every month at the ready and using them daily makes me a little nervous.",Doxepin

He wants me to try Doxepin but it’s an anti depressant which I could definitely use but I don’t want to start using it and become dependent. He said I won’t ( he’s an addiction specialist - I’m not an addict- Just FYI)  and he’s a really great doctor but I looked it up and it said you get w/d symptoms like any other AD I just want to SLEEP and reset my sleep schedule.

879,"If any of you have trouble staying asleep, maybe give Doxepin a try. I have been seeing a sleep Dr for nearly two years and tried a ton of medication. Nothing has worked. In addition to not being able to fall asleep I can't stay asleep for more than 30 minutes to save my life. Because of this I never feel any more rested than before I went to sleep. Even if I do manage to fall asleep early. I never get a full sleep cycle or even close to one. Recently another of my Dr's had me try Doxepin and it's been a God send. It's more for helping someone stay asleep rather than putting them to sleep and it works wonderfully to keep me asleep. Now I actually sleep the entire night only wake up once or twice, if at all. I've never taken anything else that has this effect on me. I've taken a ton of different medications and even if something knocked me out completely, in a couple hours I would wake up and continually wake up the rest of the night. Then when I wake up I feel horrible for not being able to stay asleep and then groggy from the medication on top of it. Being able to stay asleep has had the single biggest impact on all of my sleep issues to date. I have taken both 50mg and 100mg. From what my Dr told me sometimes it works backwards and a lower dose has more of an effect than a larger dose. Just wanted to share for anyone in the same boat as me.

TL;DR - I can never stay asleep longer than 30 mins at a time. Dr recommended Doxepin. Its purpose it to help someone stay asleep rather than put them to sleep. It's worked wonders and I now sleep all night and feel way better in the mornings.",Doxepin

Smoking an indica dominant strain didn't seem to help me much- it still tended to make my mind a little busy. I'm no scientist, but apparently your body processes THC into CBN which is the part that makes you tired.

My cousin told me about this product called Gossamer Dusk which is a full spectrum CBD oil with especially high levels of CBN. They've got a spiffy website full of information, it could be junk science for all I know but sounded plausible so I gave it a shot.

I've used it three times now and the first two nights I slept for 7 hours (!!) which hasn't happened in ages. I definitely felt a sedating and calming effect, but obviously it's subtle because it's not a psychoactive. Last night it wasn't quite as effective and I only got around 5 hours, but I blame that on having to work until late which always throws me off.

I've also been trying to do 30 minutes of cardio a day to make myself more physically tired which I think is helping. I'll check back here in a week or so and let you guys know how it's going, but wanted to share my excitement with good results so far!

Everything started in May 2018. As a result of a panic attack in my sleep, I had to endure many sleepless nights. 30-40 hours of sleep, then I had to pop a Benadryl and sleep.

Time goes forward, with a lot of migraines, anxiety and many other symptoms (aches & stuff). In June I went to a psych, and he told me to get Xanax, Doxepin (a horrible drug, don't take it) and Zolpidem. From Doxepin I had the worst anxiety, and when I wanted to sleep, I experienced random jolts.

I get my treatment, and my anxiety is not cured. Psych prescribed Zoloft, which was a wonderful drug (for me). I had to take it with Xanax and Doxepin, but I said no to those and I took Zoloft alone for two weeks, until I said 'let's see if I can work without it.' And it's incredible that now I can fall asleep without problems, even though I wake up after 3-4 hours.

I don't suffer from that anxiety anymore, even though I have panic attacks (induced by my mind). But I have to battle with gastritis/ulcer/whatever it is idk.",Doxepin

901,"FWIW, I'm sleeping sweetly every night on a very small dose of quetiapine (Seroquel). 12.5 mg of quetiapine (Seroquel) an hour before bedtime, plus melatonin, does the trick for me, reliably, every night.

A modest dose of Lunesta (1.5 mg) also helps me sleep, so does Ambien and various benzodiazepines. But I've got to be careful of getting tolerant and dependent with benzodiazepines, and my psychiatrist warns me I really should try to get along without benzos as I get older.

(My psychiatrist helps me with serious sleep problems. I don't have any other serious mental disorder, except I was an ADHD kid, a long time ago. It seems that ADHD kids tend to have sleep problems, and continue to have them in adulthood.)

Trazodone doesn't work for me. Neither does nefazodone (Serzone). Large doses of CBD don't work for me - I've tried up to 240 mg. at bedtime. Cannabis doesn't work for me. Large doses of kava don't work for me. Working with my psychiatrist, I've tried other miscellaneous meds, hoping something other than benzos would help me sleep. Large doses of Neurontin didn't work - up to 2700 mg./day. Various antidepressants didn't work. (I didn't try Remeron because I didn't want to gain a lot of weight.) Lithium didn't work. Buspar didn't work. Antihistamines at bed time don't work. Doxepin might have been somewhat helpful (can't remember, it was a long time ago), but it caused too many side effects. Melatonin at bedtime is somewhat helpful if combined with other meds. I need less of the other meds that way. If I have a good month, I can sometimes get to sleep with melatonin and no other meds. But good months come and go. Psychotherapy was nice, but didn't help me sleep better. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia has not been helpful. My sleep hygiene practices are very good. I meditate, and do relaxation exercises, which are worth doing, but they don't help me sleep any better. I don't think my life is unusually stressful. If stress is the problem, there is no way to make my life less stressful.

There are some risks with Seroquel, though they are probably dose-related, and 12.5 mg. is a really tiny dose. There are also risks with Lunesta, Ambien and other benzodiazepines. (Technically Ambien and Lunesta aren't benzos, but they work on the same receptor sites.) On the other hand, not-sleeping is really bad for you, too. When I don't get enough sleep, I feel *really terrible,* don't enjoy my life, and don't function well.

It's possible I can alternate Seroquel with Lunesta or Ambien. That might help me avoid tolerance and dependence.

Your mileage may vary. If you're desperate and out of ideas, you might consider trying a small dose of Seroquel if you know a doctor willing to prescribe. Seroquel is not FDA approved for insomnia, so some doctors will refuse. Some experts strongly object to Seroquel for insomnia, regardless of the dose. On the other hand, lots of Seroquel prescriptions for insomnia are being written these days. There's a reason. Desperate insomniacs, and their doctors, are figuring out by trial and error that it often helps with insomnia, when nothing else does.

Don't mistake my comments for medical advice. I'm not a physician anyway. Good luck!

Background: had mild insomnia my entire life.  5 years ago, diagnosed with sleep apnea (low apnea/hypopnea index, but 45 RERA events per hour, so possibly UARS instead of sleep apnea).  Prescribed CPAP at a pressure of 10, and it worked pretty well for most of the 5 years.

3 months ago, I went through a stressful time, and would have some trouble falling asleep and a lot of trouble staying asleep in the morning.  Every morning, I'd wake up 1-2 hours before I need to, be tired, but be unable to fall back asleep.  Instead of my normal 7 hours, I was getting 4 hours on a bad night, and never more than 6 hours in the last 3 months.  The stressful time is over, but the sleep maintenance insomnia is persisting.  I think anxiety about the sleep (and it's impact on my performance at work) is feeding on itself.

I've tried:

- Shifting my bedtime to be 2 hours earlier.  The morning awakenings also shifted to be 2 hours earlier.

- Melatonin 1/2 mg, no help (higher doses have helped in the past, but only for a few days, and then there's a rebound insomnia, so I don't want to try higher again)

- New sleep study to see if my sleep apnea has changed - it hasn't.

- Benadryl.  Helps me fall asleep, but I still wake up in the morning.  I'm tired, but can't fall back asleep.

- Doxepin.  3mg does nothing.  6mg lets me have broken sleep in the morning vs. no sleep at all.  So it's a small improvement, but not much.

- Ambien 10mg.  It does absolutely nothing for me - it neither helps me fall asleep, nor stay asleep.

Any tips?  I stop caffeine 10 hours before bedtime.  I normally have 1-2 alcoholic drinks in the evening, but I've tried days without that, and there's no difference.",Doxepin
913,"What Else Can I Try? First off, hey, new here. I'm a 22 year old female for reference.

I've always been a night owl who likes to sleep in, even as a child. I've never been able to fall asleep quickly, but now the insomnia has gotten to the point where it's really affecting my life in a negative way. I thought I might ""grow out of it"", but it's been years at this point. I've had to quit jobs because of the early morning requirements. I'm feeling quite hopeless after trying countless things.

I should probably point out that I have depression and anxiety issues that could be labeled ""bipolar two"". I take an antidepressant, mood stabilizer, and a benzodiazepine. 

I've tried many medications over the years. Trazadone made me nauseous and I quickly built up a tolerance to it. Seroquel helped briefly until my tolerance grew, plus it gave me uncontrollable hunger. Sonata wasn't reliable. Ativan doesn't make me sleepy. Over the counter sleep aids and antihistamines weren't helpful. Neither was Melatonin or Valerian supplements. I've been taking Doxepin for awhile, which has been satisfactory, but after a year on it, it no longer has the same effect. I know there's Ambien, but my doctor does not recommend it for me.

At one point I had a sleep study done, but that wasn't helpful since I could not fall asleep and, subsequently, was sent home at 4:30 am. It's especially hard for me to sleep anywhere but my home. In general, I often end up just laying there for hours. It's like my head won't turn off. I feel like a have permanent sleep debt and need at least ten hours of sleep to be functional.

I've also tried changing many things in my lifestyle. I've cut out alcohol and caffeine. Tried chamomile tea. I've set a bedtime and wake up time. I've stayed up for over a day to try to reset my rhythm. I've exercised and got out more. I've tried yoga and meditation. No food or tv before bed. I've tried sex. I've bought earplugs and a sleep mask. I now always sleep alone because I can't sleep a wink with a partner. I've used a ""Happy Light"" box. I've seen a therapist to get things off my mind. I've listened to music, took showers before bed, and tried turning on the fan. I've even bought new sheets, pillows, and a mattress. I've tried forgetting about trying to sleep and only going to bed when I was falling-down-dead-tired. I thought that might help with the little bit of sleep anxiety that I've developed, but I just can't fall asleep to save my life.

Marijuana has been one of the more useful things, but it's not completely reliable, is illegal in my state, and not easily accessible. I even went as far as taking painkillers or drinking before bed. Neither really worked and it definitely wasn't worth the risk.

I saw a couple doctors and they checked my blood. My thyroid is fine but my Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D levels were low. I corrected that with supplements but they had no effect on my sleep. Also, I don't have sleep apnea or anything like that. 

So here I am, seeing if anyone has any other suggestions of how to combat my insomnia?

914,"Waking up too early and can't fall asleep again? This will help Antihistamine suppresses stress hormone production that cause you to become too awake in the early hours. If you take one or two antihistamine pills before going to bed, you won't have a problem falling back to sleep in the morning. In my case I've found [ebastine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebastine) based medicines most effective. A stronger option is a small dosage of Doxepin (3-6mg) which doesn't cause much side effects as the typical clinical dosage is (50-70mg).",Doxepin

**tl;dr - Antidepressants don't seem to be working for me. Is there any hope for sedatives?**

I travel Sunday-Thursday every week and when I'm on the road I just don't sleep. 

I've talked everything over with my PCP and he initially prescribed doxepin 50mg. That had no effect on my sleep whatsoever. It only made me a little sluggish during the day and I felt kind of like Peter from Office Space. 

He then switched me over to trazodone 100mg a few days ago. This doesn't help me fall asleep either. I still wake up a couple of times during the night but it does seem to help me fall back asleep quickly.

920,"Doc wont prescribe a shit and I need help asap Hello, Im 19 and I have had sleeping issues since I can remember.

When I was a kid it was just that it took me more than 1h to get to sleep and rarely I didnt sleep at all. But as years passed this have became worse and worse.

Last night was the first time in a couple month that I managed to sleep before 3am. I was tired and lucky, I guess. Last couple months I have been having a couple non-sleep nights a week. I just cant sleep straight, I have no schedule because I just wait to be tired enought so my brain goes off. And when I sleep it takes me a lot of time in bed and my rest is shit, I wake up blasted.

My doc told me to schedule my sleep. I WISH I COULD, I tried and I cant schedule something that Im not able to do. She wont prescribe me any benzos or Z because Im 19, instead she told me to get some valerian, which I did and is useless.

Worst part is that I have already tried some benzos on my own, and atleast lorazepam doesnt help In the usual doses and I have to take 4mg to sleep (no tolerance at all, have done it a couple times).

Im desperate, I dont want to rely on some chemical but I dont think any chemical can hurt me more than not sleeping does. I have been thinking of changing doctor or buying benzos from somewhere to help me schedule and then see if I can drop them so I can use anything softer.

What do you think, guys?

925,"Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety and tons of drugs Hello, I have a close friend in another country who needs some help that he’s not getting at home.  His medical problems started about seven years ago with insomnia which snowballed into myriad other afflictions, many of them side-effects of the medications: depression, anxiety, muscle pain/weakness, persistent nausea/vomiting, total lack of appetite, ED and suicidal ideation.  He and his doctors have tried an astonishing array of drugs (detailed below) but have made no progress in treating his insomnia and the other problems reduce his quality of life to near-zero.  To complicate things further, an unfortunate family situation routinely serves to make things worse.

&#x200B;

I’m posting here today because we’re hoping to find: 

\- medical professionals who don’t believe that the answer is “more drugs”

\- other individuals struggling, recovering or recovered from similar circumstances

\- recommended courses of action

\- facilities or support organizations with relevant expertise 

&#x200B;

As his friend, I believe that his doctors at home (in a country with public healthcare) have neither the resources nor the incentives to make him better, and so their efforts to medicate him are more about stabilization than recovery.  In other words, I believe that his doctors have basically given up.  I will not.  We eagerly welcome anything positive that this community has to offer.  Thank you.

937,"14 years of insomnia My story:

When I was in my twenties I had some insomnia. It made me upset and incredibly frustrated. It went away for a while. I moved into a new home and was planning my marriage. The insomnia returned with a vengeance.

I tried Seroquel, Trazadone, going into the er after not sleeping for a couple days. Er did nothing for me.I also tried Ambien which made me puke every time I took it. It was such a painful time for me and my fiancée didn’t know what to do with me.

Eventually my doctor put me on citalopram which helped me so much.

I slept well and I took it for seven years.

Last year I decided that I wanted off of it since I wasn’t liking the way it made me feel anymore. It went well for a while. Then it didn’t. So I was prescribed doxepin which did nothing.

The insomnia got worse since February. I couldn’t sleep for hours, heart was beating fast which made me go to the bathroom every few minutes which was annoying.

Then it was not sleeping, then getting up in the middle of the night and not getting back to sleep.

Unfortunately I am now back on the citalopram, taking a half dose. Also taking melatonin.

I was and am trying lorazepam and tizanidine.

Been sleeping well for the past few nights.

Also been taking Azo bladder control which really helps with staying up and going to the bathroom all night

942,"Searching for advice Hi, so I've had insomnia for about 4 years now, it started late nineteens for me and I'm almost 24 now. Only in the last year I started treating it as Ive had enough, because it was pushing me over the edge. I've tried numerous medicines, lexapro, zopiclonum(went very badly for me, like uncontrollable anxiety and vomiting bad), trazodone, (which worked okay on some days with little side effects), lorazepam which worked by far the best for sleep and mood but my doctor refused to perscribe  me more than a month.

So at last I want to ask about a drug called valdoxan. I have been taking it 2 nights so far with not really any effect. Its a 25mg dose. Is there a specific amount of time I should take it before bed, or right when I get into bed? My problem is primarily chronic insomnia and severe at that so I'm wondering if anyone has any more information on if the drug should help sleep immediately or do I have to wait?

My doctor told me to take 1 for a week a night  and if I don't feel am effect take 2 a night.",Lorazepam
943,"ADHD and insomnia. How to cope? I debated whether to post here or r/adhd but I figured I should start here.

I’m at my absolute wits end with this and am desperate for some advice. I’m 24 and have had insomnia for at least half my life. But over the last few months it’s been especially bad to the point where i’m lucky if I get 3 hours of sleep a night now. It’s not even restful sleep either. And like the title says, I have ADHD which makes it so much harder.

I feel like I have tried everything under the sun. I have tried 5 different brands of melatonin and nothing. I turn off tech at least an hour before bed and have started exercising again (on top of that I do have a job that requires a ton of walking and physical labor). I don’t consume any caffeine or alcohol and don’t eat sugar after dinner. 

I have tried CBD, gummies, and weed countless times. Gummies and weed do slow me down and make me tired but not sleepy. I usually get bad highs from them lately too so it’s not worth it. I have a prescription for lorazepam however i’m not keen on using it often as it rarely works and my body gets addicted to it. I use it once and then I can’t sleep at all the next day so it’s not worth it to me either. Sleep aids/diphenhydramine doesn’t do it for me as even on the occasion it does work, i’ll still abruptly wake up after 3-4 hours and not be able to sleep again. 

I’ll usually drink sleepy time tea or warm milk before bed but it doesn’t work. I have lavender pillow spray and lavender oil I put in a diffuser but that doesn’t work either. Music is nothing but annoying and distracting. 

I’m on no other medications and I do have worries like everyone else but that’s not what’s keeping me up I think. I don’t know what is going on but I can’t keep it up anymore. I’m constantly taking painkillers for headaches/migraines due to lack of sleep and I feel dizzy/fatigued at all times. My vision is bleary i’m always seeing those black dots in my eyes because i’m that sleep deprived.  Honestly, I wouldn’t say i’m suicidal or anything but i’m terrified i’m gonna get to that point if this keeps up much longer. 

So yeah. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",Lorazepam
944,"Help please :( Hi. I'm experiencing some of the heaviest anxiety of my life and I don't know where else to turn. I'm a 23 y/o M. I really started struggling with anxiety when I was 18, though I suspect I may have had issues with it earlier based on memory. Anxiety/Sleep disorders run in my family for preface. 
I was able to solve them mostly at the time, so I had to leave my job, got prescribed Hydroxyzine which still works decently well to this day. Then, around 2019, so two years after I had the initial problem, I took a second job to help cover costs at my house, only weekends though. Biggest mistake ever. I went through a few nights where I didn't sleep due to stress, and ended up quitting that new job only two weekends in. I got offered full time at Hobby Lobby, where I still am employed to date. It was fine for awhile, minor nights of bad sleep but I was never really ""worried"" about it per-sey. 
So everything was looking up right? That's what I thought too. Then, quarantine hit. I started staying up really late playing games/watching videos, would go to bed around 6/7AM and wake up at 2-3PM. This went on for a couple months, then had to go back to work. Long story short, big surprise, going to wake up early again, couldn't sleep. I got 2-3 hours for 2 consecutive days, working a 9-9 shift at work, came home after the third day expecting to crash because I was so tired. Nope. Panic attack to the fullest, I was twitching, crying, went to the hospital because I thought I was legitimately doomed, they gave me Lorazepam, ended up out like a light. 
Since, I started taking better care of myself. Give myself an hour to relax before bed. Have to be in bed by 2AM at the max, take Hydroxyzine to relax. All was good for awhile, a few bad nights of sleep which I was now starting to worry about owing to my past experiences with sleep. 
It was around this time I started becoming a Hypochondriac as well. If I felt ill with something, constantly looked by symptoms. It didn't really affect me alot at the time. Then, come September, moved out of my parent's place into an apartment with my cousin. I was worried about sleeping away from home, but did so just fine. Had a few flare-ups in November and December for a week where I didn't sleep particularly well, got prescribed Trazadone (hit or miss with me). 
Then, around this time, something within me has snapped. I got prescribed Seroquel last week because I had a small issue sleeping and brought it up to my doctor, and slept for 8 hours about 5-6 consecutive days. Then, two days ago hits. Can't sleep until 4AMish, call off work, slept from about 9AM-1PM. Nothing new, have done it a few times before. Pills seem to be ineffective again. Then, my hypochondria gets the best of me. I look up insomnia and the different types, and came across FFI and SFI, both fatal forms of insomnia. Er, maybe I shouldn't say Insomnia, but it is a very common symptom owing to a psionic gene in the brain that mutates, if I read correctly. I started freaking out. Last night, I tried to sleep at midnight, ended up tossing and turning and wanting to cry regarding the thought. My anxiety wouldn't let me sleep. My hypochondriac mind wants to believe I have this terrible disease that is very rare and only within certain bloodlines (of which mine is not one), but my mind thinks I have it anyways, or have the spontaneous version (very very rare to get, actually better chance of winning the lotto, again, from researching the topic). Didn't crash until idk when, but I did get sleep, woke up at 9 today but only probably slept 2-3 hours. 
I wanna cry. My mind won't let go of the thought that by some slim miracle chance I have it, and that I'll be dead in 6 months, unable to sleep, suffering. I'm terrified of sleeping tonight, that my meds again won't help. That I'm in a downward spiral that I can't climb out of. I need someone's help, encouraging words, ANYTHING. I'm hopefully seeing a therapist Wednesday, and I'm talking to my psychiatrist later, but I'm so scared. Please help :( I don't wanna die!

946,"Words of reassurance needed I’ve been drinking and smoking many nights a week for five years to get me to sleep. I didn’t realize until recently that it had such an impact and that without it I am now a gibbering wreck. I also took Seroquel and recently I also took CBD. Its weird because I wasn’t scared of not sleeping I didn’t mind that I was adding more and more stuff to this cocktail.... 
It all started around six weeks ago with a big panic attack from taking too much CBD (I have a bad relationship with cannabis products, they generally give me anxiety). Now my sleep is fucked and I am either exhausted or anxious beyond belief and quite often both. 
I’ve take Trazadone (100mgs), Seroquel (25mgs) and 1mgs of Lorazepam the last week and its been going ok. I sleep but its an anxious, confused, scared sleep and I feel like I’m often awake even though I don’t remember it all that well in the morning. I can’t sleep in like I used to. But I’m trying to stop the Benzo and I’m running out of Trazadone so I halfed the dose of both last night. I slept maybe 3-4 hours restlessly and listlessly.
I just feel like I lack the know how of getting back into a state of comfort, where my brain relax. I feel the relaxation coming and then my fucking mind is like ‘oh no you don’t!’ And I’m back in the fucking death spiral.
I started Brintellix (an ssri) yesterday and I’m praying to all the gods in all the heavens and all the hells that it will give me comfort. They say 1-2 weeks and sleep should start getting better. 
In the past episodes like this have been defeated by Lexapro (which I stopped early last year) Seroquel, but this has been the worst one yet and I just hope a new pill will bring some desperately needed comfort.
Periodically sfi crosses my mind and I’m terrified, the fatigue from constantly being anxious and not sleeping great makes me feel cognitively impaired. However I work as a secretary in a doctors practice, I go to school, I can hold conversations about fairly complicated issues. 
I just want you guys to tell me its going to be ok... Sometimes I wonder if I should go to the icu, or get sectioned, just so I can be somewhere where I know I’m being looked after and people will notice if something is horribly wrong.

949,"Magnesium for insomnia/anxiety? Hey guys, so I've been on the insomnia train for about a month now and I'm curious to try out different options now. The only medicine so far that's actually helped me sleep was lorazepam (anxiety medication). I keep hearing from doctors that it can be addicting so I definitely want to ease away from using it as much as I can. I've used it 5 times so far in the past month, spread apart ish. 50mg of Trazodone only made me feel groggy and shitty the next day and did little to no effect on me on falling asleep. 

Anywho, MAGNESIUM. I keep hearing about it from people around me. What are your guys thoughts? Is it on the same noob level as melatonin for us severe insomnia and anxiety folk? 

I'm curious to try it out at least. I've only barely started to do some research on it. I read a thread where some girl who takes it for ADHD and it keeps her calmer and focused.
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/Your-Supplements-Magnesium-Glycinate-Capsules/dp/B01K1JEVA4/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=magnesium+glycinate&qid=1611522027&sr=8-5&ref_=d6k_applink_bb_marketplace

This is the one she uses apparently. I read another thread where magnesium glycinate like the one listed above helped someone with anxiety and falling asleep. 

Someone also commented that magnesium could potentially give you energy based on.. (some neurological  thing someone posted.., something along the lines of ""gaba-inhibiter-output"" I could be way off. 
 
I was reading the description of the one on the Amazon link and it somewhere it said aids with sleepyness, however it also says it fights tiredness and fatigue? Now the fatigue I don't mind being lessened, but isn't tiredness what we need in order to fall asleep, so does it really help? I may be overcomplicating it/reading too much into it. That's just my anxious brain at hand for you. 
Either way, there seems to be many different kinds of magnesium pills.

2) If so, what kind do you take?

951,"Temazepam, xanax, edibles, diphenhydramine, doxycycline...? (Long) I currently use some of the meds in the title (prescribed by my family doctor where required), and rotate so I rarely take the same choice two nights in a row. I'm a bit concerned over dependency and of effects wearing off, though only the temazepam has had an increased dose and that was within 2 weeks of starting and that was 9 months ago.

The xanax was originally for anxiety (autistic teen son) but it works for insomnia. I'm not sure it's really meant for that though.

Temazepam and xanax both give vivid dreams which are usually ok (ie not nightmares) but I can sometimes wake from an intense dream feeling like I've had an exhausting day! It does wear off before too long though.

Diphenhydramine and doxycycline just make me sleepy the entire following day, even at a half dose.

The Dr did have me on, I think, lorazepam but it did nothing for me. Melatonin did nothing at night but gave me a hangover the next day, even on a minimal dose.

I can buy indica edibles here legally but there's still that stigma over them. Frankly they seem to work better with fewer side effects than regular medicine. I'm just concerned at long term effects and any drug tests I might need for whatever reason, and I can't travel with them.

I've been on a number of antidepressants over my lifetime. None have done me any good - in fact, each time it's been a relief to get off them, such were the side effects.

957,"Hormonal factors: Insomnia My insomnia first began 3 years ago.

Before this, I was a light sleeper. I never had any real issues falling asleep.. eventually. However, I have always had hormonal issues since puberty. Such as PMS, severe pains, pcos diagnosis etc. 

In the past they hadn't affected my ability to sleep unless I was in a lot of pain. I noticed that 3 years ago my period had vanished around the same time I was experiencing some severe digestive issues. 

I had extreme bloating, and I was unable to release my bowels properly. Even on a diet that was high in fluids and easily digestible foods. This problem has been persisent until maybe 3 months ago. I was on a vegan diet which may have triggered such issues (SIBO) 

My period was absent for 6 months, and even upon it returning the insomnia did not get better. In fact, the endo pains were the worst they've ever been. The pattern I have noticed is a week before my period, I literally cannot sleep at all. And I mean, I will go for full days with no sleep. 

After not sleeping for days at a time, if I do eventually sleep it is for a couple of hours, then that night I may not sleep again. This can send me into somewhat of a psychosis or constant state of panic because my body can't regulate stress / engage with reality. 

Much of that is to be expected when the body is weak and unable to heal / rest. To not sleep is torture. I have lost my ability to work because of this major reason, among some other health issues I am facing. Sleep is too inconsistent to be reliable and alert.

My sleep problem is by far the most insidious issue I have had to date. Without sleep, the body cannot heal. What I can't understand is why would the body deny itself of the very thing it needs the most?

I haven't successfully been able to control it through diet, exercise, or meditations. I've tried some of the strongest natural medicines, melatonin, magnesium, things like ashwaghanda, 5htp, rhodiola, gaba, scullcap, valerian, liquid kava, various Chinese herbs etc. 

The sedative pharmaceutical options made me really aggressive - temazepam etc. The only thing that works for me at the moment is lorazepam (ativan) which is extremely difficult to consistently attain. I am thankful for the benzos, but I'm also afraid of the long term effects.

A strange thing I have noticed: Before I started having these issues I could lay in bed at night and visualise or imagine scenes in my mind. I could use these ""movie like"" inages to drift off to sleep or enter relaxation mode. 

Now, (and over the last 3 years) I've lost my ability to visualise things in my mind. I believe it is called Aphantasia. I literally lay there and hear words in the forefront of my mind.


And so the cycle continues... One week before my period I cannot sleep, the week of my period I cannot sleep; Stress, hbp, endometriosis pains and fibro flare ups. Then the week after I feel extremely drained, not enough sleep if any (5 hours or so)

> My blood work is relatively normal. Surprise surprise 🙄 however, my progesterone is a bit low? I am treating it with supplements. I am always slightly anemic no matter what I eat. In the past my iron was the same, but i was sleeping fine. So it's not that. I recently had a CT scan that showed a slightly enlarged thyroid.

I'm wondering if I should have extensive tests done. I had regular tests that showed nothing abnormal.. But I have heard that the current blood testing screen (Australia) rarely shows anything relevant to the conditions we can have.

Over the last 5 years I have been clean eating with no alcohol, no drugs or cigarettes, no caffiene or processed sugars / foods. I eat whole foods and organic produce, I take a lot of supplements and teas. I exercise as much as I can. Cannabis makes me more mentally alert at night unfortunatley and cbd oil does something similar.

I am really at a loss here. I suffer extreme fatigue, vision problems and dizziness along with the insomnia. On days I don't sleep my muscle weakness and lack of equilibrium makes it difficult to leave the house.

964,"6 months of severe Insomnia, fully recovered, I hope my story helps someone.   

THIS IS A CONDENSED VERSION OF MY STORY. 

History: No previous mental health issues until this point, aged 29, this can REALLY happen to anyone. 

The Cause: Stress, I was in the process of emigrating which was all very 50/50 up until the last minute, along with this uncertainty and constant stress of the process, there was also work pressure which became too much. 

The Insomnia: I was a regular 8hr sleeper, maybe waking up once or twice a night to use the bathroom, then literally out of nowhere BOOM 3hrs of broken sleep then into work…. the next night the same…. The next night the same… this snowballed so fast it’s hard to comprehend now I’m out the otherside, the worst I can recall was 5hrs total sleep over 4 days/night…. At this point I could not function let alone do my job…. Luckily for me my work is project based and happened to be quiet at time, I took a week off to try and catch up on sleep and to try and recharge myself, but this was no use…. You see the vicious cycle is: You’re awake when you should be asleep > creates anxiety/stress > tired which feeds anxiety/stress> your body/mind then enters fight or flight mode(you must be staying awake for a reason it thinks right!?)>this then makes the possibility of falling asleep almost impossible, the worst I can remember of this was at the very start when I would be close to falling asleep and I would either get a rush of adrenaline or a physical spasm or jerk, torture, there’s no other word to describe it. I genuinely thought at this point my life as I knew it was over, this was a new normal for me, barely being able to get through the day and killing myself just to do that, all the enjoyment sucked out of life, it’s almost like you’re in a fantasy watching everyone else go about their normal lives, people who have had insomnia will understand this. My insomnia lasted a total of 6 months, I’d say 2/3 of these months were ‘severe’ …3-4 hours of sleep every night no exceptions or miracles. 

The Recovery: After trying numerous natural remedies (I knew I was beyond this, but to progress to medication I had to go through these options) I was finally prescribed with Zopiclone, this would help me fall asleep but the first time I would wake up that would be it, awake until the alarm, this would maybe get me 4 hours of sleep, it wasn’t the drug that was the problem, it was me: Over this period of insomnia I’d just developed a ton of really bad and anxious habbits that weren’t there before, having to have everything PERFECT before going to sleep, If I remembered something that wasn’t I’d have to get up and go sort it, my pillow had to be PERFECT…. Room temperature PERFECT … if any of these weren’t, I would get annoyed thus not sleeping….. the turning point for me arrived two pronged at the same time, I was prescribed Lorazepam/Ativan 2mg and along with this had just had my worst night sleep to date, all I can describe of the next day It was almost like my body/mind had gotten sick of being sick, sick of hearing my own voice talk about the same things sleep sleep sleep, sick of being tired, to the point where over night I completely let go of all caring, I’m so tired and bored I genuinely don’t care what happens now, sleep no sleep… whatever…. Keep my job lose my job… whatever… and this is how fucked up and cruel the body and mind can be… it was at this point of being so low, that I started to recover. Along with this new frame of mind (no doing of my own) and my new medication, I began to sleep again…. Initially 6hrs of broken sleep…. 7hrs of broken sleep….. 5hrs of solid sleep followed by 2hrs of sleep…. 4hrs of sleep followed by 4 hrs of sleep… etc. etc. In a little over 2 months I had my life back to a point where I was enjoying life to the fullest, but this medication had side effects, and I wanted to kick it and sleep naturally again, sleeping on Benzo’s is not as restful as sleeping naturally, best way to describe it is you’ll only ever feel like 7/10. 

The Taper: Over another 2 months I tapered off this medication, it’s as grim as everyone say’s it is, I found the initial drops to be the worst, once I got into the smaller doses I found the withdrawals manageable. 

I’m now completely clean and am sleeping 7/8hrs a night waking up 1-2 times, I’m proof that anyone can get this and ANYONE can beat this.

My chronic insomnia started 2 years ago. I believe it was because of my job that would start at 6am and I was afraid I wouldn't make it. I left my job 4 months ago but the struggle is continuing. 

I have anxiety all my life but recently I get so anxious before sleeping that I can't sleep even when I'm tired...

On a weekly basis I visit a therapist who's awesome and he's really trying to help but nothing is working so far. Even if I am able to sleep I wake up at around 3 and can't go back to sleep. I suffer and suffer until my boyfriend wakes up so happily and starts having an amazing mood. And he also says he's sorry I have a bad day again. That's it. I mean I know that he's doing his best with my chronic insomnia but I can never stop being jealous of people who enjoy the sleep without even thinking about it...

I took LORAZEPAM for 8 months last year. I stopped it when I realize that every 2 months I should get a bigger doze to be able to sleep. I tried pretty much everything : herbs, massages, breathing, yoga, therapy, dancing, painting. Last 2 years I've been looking for all kinds of activities that could help me with insomnia and panic attacks afterwards. I traveled a lot hoping to change the scenery but nothing is changed. When I can't sleep I get so anxious that my head spins around, I want to throw up and sometimes want to go out and scream about my pain.

I heard that CBD oil can help but as I'm in a country where it's not being sold so I am afraid to order it and later have problems with the law... 

I swear I don't know what else to do. I have everything to enjoy my life but I can't do it because of my sleep disorder. 

Actually, right now I just want to hear that I'm not alone. I believe this isn't going to leave for awhile or maybe forever. 

Patience to all of us and have a good day or night wherever you are!",Lorazepam

I have tried everything else, valerian, melatonin, you name it, nothing has worked for me except prescription drugs like lorazepam. But this KAVANS seems to help.

I smoked my last joint 3 days ago, since it started to trigger lots of anxieties. Now I´m TERRIFIED of going to sleep. I used to love to sleep and used to love my bed, but now the only thing I can think about is: ""Am I able to sleep tonight? How am I supposed to work?""

It gets so bad I have to start crying really hard. I´m even crying while writing this. I´m so afraid to go to bed. The entire day I think about tonight and work tomorrow and how I can endure this.

Update: thanks for all the encouragement everyone. I slept nine hours last night. I know this isn’t sustainable, but here’s what I did. I took lorazepam throughout the day .25mg each time and took .5mg before bed. I turned off my phone and tv at 7. I drank a sleepytime tea. I ate a banana. I drank some tart cherry juice. I stretched for 15 minutes and focused on a meditative state of mind. I sat in a rocking chair next to my bed and read and listened to calm.com relaxing nature music until I started to fall asleep. Then I turned off the light, turned on sleepgenius on repeat and laid down. Was asleep in 1 minute or so. The sleep hygiene stuff is sustainable. But that was the most lorazepam I’ve ever taken in one day. I did this with the advice of my doctor.

976,"Eating much less sugar seems to have helped my insomnia massively. I've been an insomniac since I was in my early teens - I'm now 35. Like most people reading this, I've been through all the tortures of insomnia; the effects it's had on every part of my life have been enormous. I've also tried, over the years, all of the commonly – and less commonly – advised measures to help beat it (with the notable exception of CBTI because it's never been available to me). For a long time I've been settled in a not-so-happy middle ground of accepting frequent poor sleep, and self medicating sleeping pills (valium, lorazepam, and clonazepam are currently on my bedside - I try to avoid using these as much as possible, but it's kind of comforting to know that they're there)

&#x200B;

I've always had a sweet tooth, but never went totally crazy on sugar binges. I'd say my sugar consumption has been about average for someone from The West, or even on the lower end of the scale, considering how much sugar is in many people's diets.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been reading a few articles by people who'd cut down on, or cut out entirely, their sugar intake, and who wrote about the range of benefits they experienced (mainly fewer mood swings and more energy, but also less worry about the health risks associated with eating too much sugar). I don't think any of them mentioned better sleep, and I wasn't reading these articles with my insomnia in mind. But anyway, I started cutting down on how much sugar I eat, and I quickly saw a correlation between the days when I ate less sugar and the nights when I slept well, and the days when I slipped up and ate my normal amount of sugar, and nights when I slept badly. I do still have a pretty sugary iced coffee every morning, but apart from that I now snack on things like nuts, beans and roasted peas, and I try to resist sugary things later in the day. In fact I try not to eat anything containing added sugar after about midday.

I certainly can't say for sure that eating less sugar causing me to sleep better - it feels like it is, but it's only been a couple of weeks. But, in that time I have had a couple of nights when I went to bed thinking ""yeah, I'm not going to sleep well tonight - I  can just *feel* it"" - I'm sure all insomniacs know that feeling, and it's usually pretty accurate. Well, since cutting back on sugar, on those nights I fell asleep quickly and I slept soundly. And most nights since I've started eating less sugar, I've had the sleeping habits of a normal sleeper. My body tells me when I need to go to bed, I go up stairs and get ready for bed, read a page or two of my book and get drowsy. I put the book down, close my eyes and then shortly afterwards it's morning! All without sleeping pills.

&#x200B;

What's interesting to me is that from what I recall it's never been suggested to me to cut down on sugar in order to sleep better – not by doctors, nor by any of the numerous articles and books I've read on insomnia. I just Googled ""best ways to beat insomnia"", and none of the articles mention sugar. But now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense to me – to the point where feel pretty stupid for not thinking of it years ago! Some people could surely be less tolerant to high-sugar diets, and it could affect their sleep. Also research shows that insomnia increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. I've not read any of these studies, but the obvious question is could it be because the insomniacs studied ate more sugar, or had a lower tolerance to the sugar in their diets?

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in case it clicks with anyone else. I'm only a datapoint of one, so I really don't want to get anyone's hopes up. Believe me, I know what it's like to try something new to beat insomnia, only for it to fail. But maybe give it a go if you're an insomniac. There are other major benefits to eating less sugar, so even if it doesn't help your insomnia, you'll be making a positive change to your overall health.

&#x200B;

I'd love to know what people think. Has anyone been advised to eat less sugar because of their insomnia? Has anyone tried this and found it to be effective, or tried and it hasn't worked?",Lorazepam
977,"Please help ... any experience with Trimipramine or Quazepam? Can anyone share experiences with trimipramine or quazepam for insomnia?  Especially treatment-resistant or medication-induced insomnia?  Or suggestions for lesser-known more obscure sleep medications?

Trimipramine looks sedating with less likelihood of weight gain and a long half-life.  Quazepam (a benzo) isn't ideal, but it has a long half-life and is more selective for the hypnotic GABA receptors than other benzos.

I'm struggling hard.  Even if I can drug myself to sleep, I wake up 4-6 hours later and have been resorting to zolpidem (Ambien) to get 8 hours.

Many drugs are too weak ... benadryl, unisom, hydroxyzine, clonidine etc.

I was put on trazadone a year and a half ago.  Started at 50mg and it worked great for a few months.  Then I had to bump up to 100mg.  Last few months my doc bumped it up to 200mg, and even told me to take 300mg if that didn't work.


I also have general anxiety and my doc Rx Lorazapam, on an ""as needed"" base with not a lot of pills.  Turns out Lorazapam helps me sleep way better than trazadone currently.  I can take 300mg of traz and wake up 3.5 hours later wide awake and I end up taking something else to get back to sleep otherwise I'd be awake for another 2 hours or more.


In related history I have taken clonapin to sleep and I read lorazapan is closely related so that might be why it works.  To be fair it was my wife's clonapin that she never took so it was never Rx to me.   Is it difficult to get a doc to regulate prescribe benzodiazepines type drugs to take on a regular basis?

- Diazepam (Valium)

- Cannabis
- Alcohol

Ambien and Cannabis where the only two things that really helped. The Problem with Ambien beeing it just fucks up my Memory SERIOUSLY.

982,"Extremely persistent maintenance sleeplessness. Hi, 

A couple of months ago I was taken to the ER because of multiple panic attacks, which had me unable to fall asleep (shivers, reflux,...).  They put me on a benzo, without informing me of the long-term risks.  After 2 weeks of what seemed like calmness in a pill ( 1mg Lorazepam ), I had to learn the hard truth about benzo's. Tolerance had built and my anxiety and my sleep became much worse than before. I had to live with 4-5 hours of sleep, while waking up at least once most of the time and having to calm myself to sleep afterwards. After a total of 7 weeks use, including the taper, my sleep was terrible. I had to start taking Mirtazapine 15mg to get even a decent amount of sleep.

I've been taking the Mirtazapine for 2 months now, and the k.o. effect is less prominent. However, from the moment I started mirt., I've still had the awakenings during the night, feeling wired. Most of the time, I'm able to fall back asleep but sometimes it's so bad that I can't.

I'm not sure whether this is still due to the benzo ( 7 weeks of 1mg or less Lorazepam ), or this could be cortisol spiking in the night. I find that melatonin helps. I'm taking it at doses < 1mg. This would make sense, since Melatonin has an inverse relationship with Cortisol. I'm also very sensitive ( in a good way ) to anything GABA-related like even chamomille tea.

Is there anyone who has benefitted from taking like say pharmaGABA? I've read conflicting evidence regarding its efficacy in crossing the BBB ( blood-brain barrier ). Any other suggestion are welcome.",Lorazepam

Tonight I'm going to take 4 mg. of Melatonin and after 3 AM I will take 1 mg. of lorazepam because I can't just cold turkey from lorazepam. I also had very disturbing dreams.

984,"Really struggling just now. Hi there
I've been posting a lot on r/anxiety and basically a progression of issues have occurred due to my anxiety, now disturbing my sleep.

I basically cannot fall asleep and stay asleep like normal.

I was prescribed Gravol (anti emetic) for nausea and vomiting related to my anxiety, which I was told was a drowsy pill, and it knocked me out for 4 hours the first time I took it. I've had it another 2 times, it's done nothing more than make me feel heavy. This is probably linked to me feeling anxious about not sleeping and being ineffective but still frustrating.

I also am having reflux issues just now, which ranitidine is helping with but I am finding I am vomiting once between 4am - 8am every morning.

What happens with the sleep is I am feeling really exhausted, having visual disturbances through lack of sleep, and generally feel tired but my mind just feels....blank. It's hard to describe; it feels wired but at the same time empty. It was initially very chaotic and my thoughts were racing, but now it's just silent and wired.

I lay down and don't check the time or any electronics, and find when it's morning or when I have gotten up to vomit, I don't feel I have slept at all, but again I am very confused to know for sure have I slept or not. I certainly don't feel like I have.

I have sedatives (Lorazepam) from the doctor which I have not tried yet. Has anyone here taken this to aid sleep? I read it could help with this. It's a 0.5mg dose I have been given, sublingual.

Also, does anyone have experience in the Gravol becoming effective again, or should I just resign myself to it won't help any longer? It does work to settle my stomach when I'm super nauseated through anxiety.
Any other recommendations for either over the counter sleep aids, or something to ask for when I return to the doctor this week?

I have tried numerous ""holistic"" techniques, but am finding I cannot practice meditation as effectively as I used to due to my mind either racing or not being able to focus on relaxation techniques.
I also am having to be super cautious with my food intake to not make me further sick/nauseous/acidic. Just feel crap right now. Last slept last Tuesday. 

I have this weird thing where I don't know if I've slept or not, but going by how often I am tossing and turning, I think I'm getting about 30 - 60 minutes a night. 

The doctor has prescribed Lorazepam for my anxiety to use sparingly, I haven't tried it yet, but I am really tempted to try it to see if it helps with this issue too. My mind just won't switch off at all :(

Has anyone had a sleep after taking Lorazepam?

985,"Lorazepam (Ativan) and zolpidem (Ambien) stopped working. Back in May, I got my first full-time job and moved out of my parents' house. The job has me doing 12-hour night shifts, so as a person who already struggles with anxiety, depression, and insomnia, sleep is more of a precious resource than ever.

It took several weeks for me to adjust to having a ""real"" job with long shifts and living without my parents. There were also some traumatic events that occurred shortly after I moved that plagued me with constant panic attacks and left me struggling to eat or sleep. I was already on the lower end of average weight and lost between 5 to 10 lbs., and I was only getting between 1 to 4 hours of sleep every day for 2+ months.

I stopped taking antidepressants earlier in the year, which was a huge mistake. I went to a psychiatrist to start medication again, and I was prescribed a combination of escitalopram (Lexapro) and bupropion (Wellbutrin). She also gave me lorazepam to help with my panic attacks and sleep. It didn't help particularly well with sleep, but it was decent for panic attacks as long as I didn't use it often enough to build a tolerance. Since the lorazepam failed to grant me a full night (er, day) of sleep, she prescribed me zolpidem.

The zolpidem worked at first. In fact, it worked a little *too* well -- I was exhausted even after sleeping for eight hours. However, after 5 days, it stopped working entirely. I decided to try alternating between zolpidem and lorazepam, which worked to some extent. I'm not sure if that will fix the issue anymore, though. Most recently, I woke up two or three times during my slumber before having to leave for work.

My boyfriend sometimes snores like a hibernating bear (how the fuck does he manage to sleep so easily, anyway?), which is grating and exacerbates my sleep issues. I can hear him through earplugs and headphones more often than not. I've left our shared bedroom several times to go sleep on a big piece of cardboard on my office floor. However, I don't think bed quality (or lack thereof) is the issue. Even when I sleep alone in our Tempur-Pedic, I still wake up after a few hours if the sleep aids aren't working. It wouldn't be a big deal if I could at least go back to sleep shortly after, but I'm losing sleep as I wait to fall asleep again.

This is also how it was for me.  Ambien/temazepam/lorazepam seemed to just seemed useless when my insomnia was bad, but I responded well to trazodone.  I've also heard the opposite where some insomniacs only respond to meds like ambien and benzos but trazodone made them angry or didn't help.

I was just a incredibly light sleeper but i'm becoming more convinced its a bigger issue. This is more a rant than anything, i'm not even sure where to go/what to do. 

I went my Dr and he suggested a script of Ambien and I swear for the first week, it appeared to work. However the following week it just seemed to not work and actually raise my heart rate. I literally felt like I was having a mini heart attack as I lay in bed for many hours. I spoke with my dr and he took me off the Ambien and just put in a prescription for lorazepam. I'm super hesitant about taking this stuff and I wanna try a few other things before I end up hooked on something. 

I feel like a zombie and its taking its toll on me. I've tried using Melatonin and it seems to be hit or miss for me.

**Should I start seeing a Psychiatrist instead?**
I have always have had this idea in my head that sleeping should be to a minimum and there is always something to be done instead. 

**How much does alcohol affect sleeping?** I always find if I drink its even harder then it already is to sleep. I've been progressively cutting back more and more. I know not to mix any meds with drinking.


The other thing is my job for the past 3 years has a on call rotation for IT which can have the phone ringing at any time and i'm expected to wake up from a dead sleep/respond. When I first started it I would be awake for days from the anxiety of awaiting a phone call to a potentially major issue. I feel like im getting better and learning to not be as nervous as I have a better understanding of solving problems now vs back then. Mentally i'm not thinking about it nearly as much. But its always in the back of my mind. Luckily its only 1 week out of a month but it is 24/7 support.

It started with a sleepless night, then another followed up by a few hours during the day and then a night another night with 0 sleeps. I have never had  sleeping problems and I started to get scared so I finally went to the walk in clinic and they prescribed lorazepam to me. The drug helped me sleep and I managed to make it through the next few days and caught up on most of my sleep before having a mini relapse a few days later.

The rest of that week I finally started to sleep normal again and stopped taking the drug and began to trust myself and got over a lot of my anxiety. The following week I had a total relapse and started taking the pills again every other night and managed to make it to the weekend only having 1 or 2 nights without much sleep. I have now run out of pills 

The last 2 days were awful and I am finding it almost impossible to fall asleep now. My mom gave me some herbs which have helped to relax me a bit and now I'm wondering if I should just forget the pills and try the all natural route. I know that pills are not a long term solution and this week I was perscribed some different pills (trazodome) and frankly I am terrified of the side effects and I don't even want to take 1. 

Do herbs have an scientific basis? I don't really like to waste my time with alternative medicine but I also don't want to take drugs with wacky side effects that I might get hooked on. I really hope this insomnia eventually passes for me :(. ",Lorazepam

996,"How I significantly improved my insomnia (long) (TL;DR at bottom)

I know there's no one size fits all cure. I am not preaching this and saying you have to do any of this, but I thought it would be good to post this because this is what I did, and it worked for my insomnia. It has been almost a year and I've had waaaaay less issues with insomnia. It usually only takes about 2 hours to fall asleep at the most and I usually get 8 - 9 hours of sleep. It's been about 10 months since I've had an all-nighter. Huge win for me. I am no longer in fear going to bed like I once was. My fear of bed/sleep has gone down from a 9/10 to a 2/10.

My history is a very long and confusing one and actually the main problem in my life was and still is chronic nerve pain. I worked very hard at healing myself through many treatmets and avenues and even though it did not cure my pain, it helped with my second biggest problem, insomnia. It is wildly better. Right now as I type this I'm really scared that I am going to jynx things and cause myself to have insomnia tonight because I am now talking about it but it's a risk I'm going to take because I know the suffering of insomnia is so real, and if I can help even one person that would be amazing. Again I am not forcing this on anyone, this is just what I did. 

For two years I struggled with moderate-severe insomnia. One of two things would happen. I would go to bed at 11 pm and not be able to fall asleep until 5 or 6 am, or I would stay up all night. Longest I've gone without sleep would be about 85 hours. This all while I was on baclofen and quetiapine. I also suffered with tremors, jolts, vibrating and many strange things that my body/nervous system does while lying in bed. I still suffer with those things but not as badly. 

I have been on quetiapine since 2014 and put me to sleep easily for yearss. Then in 2019 it just suddenly stopped working as it usually did. (I am still on it and it feels like it's kinda back to how it use to work).

I started (and still am) taking a million supplements but the ones that I think helped with sleep are magnesium bisclycinate 400 mg and L-theanine 200 mg. Also two drops of liquid vitamin D. I take that every night about an hour before bed. If anyone would like the full list of supplements I take just ask.

Because of suicidal ideation, how severe my pain was, my history of anxiety, and a psychotic episode I had at my psychiatrist's office, he prescribed me with .25 mg of clonazepam which I take once a day in the afternoon. I know benzos are bad for you long term but I don't care lol. It's something I literally can't care about right now. But it likely helped my nervous system calm down and let my body regulate sleep again. I do not take it at night nor do I take it **to** go to sleep. I just feel it's only fair for me to mention that I'm on it. So now I'm on baclofen, clonazepam and quetiapine which can be dangerous but it's what Ive been on for a year and my pharmacy is aware and I have been fine. Just warning others out there that the combination of those drugs can cause laboured breathing. **I am not trying to endorse benzo use just want to say that I am on clonazepam to give full transparency**

I work-out for about 15 - 30 minutes almost every day, in summer I took walks, now in winter I go to a gym, treadmill, elliptical, stairmaster. Or i do 2-4 hours of heavy duty house cleaning, or dancing, lol. Literally I went only two days without exercise recently and my body was twitching, jolting and vibrating more than normal and it took me about 2.5 hours to fall asleep, tossing and turning constantly. I literally **have** to exercise and cannot go more than 2 days without exercise or my body has too much excess energy and will feel jumpy at night and I will not sleep properly. I am trapped, I literally have to exercise.

I do yoga/stretch almost every night for 10 minutes. I know yoga is the most annoying suggestion in the world lol but again, I'm just stating what I do and what I have incorporated into my life over the past year. Usually the stretching/yoga I do involves deep breathing. I can post the video of which yoga exercise I do the most often if anyone is interested. It's beginner aka easy to do.

This one is the most ""out there"" and probably going to get laughed at, but I don't give a shit because it helps me relax before going to sleep. And as you all know, when you're suffering you'll try just about anything. I do EFT tapping every single night. It is a form of meditation. I use an app and if anyone wants more details on it, just ask me and I'll tell you. I just don't want it to sound like I'm trying to sell something. I do two guided meditations before bed, one of them is  behind the paywall and one of them is free, so again if you want to know the app and the name of the free meditation, feel free to ask me. If EFT is too hippie-dippie then alternatively I just recommend doing traditional meditation for 10 minutes a night. But the reason I do ""tapping"" meditation is because ironically, traditional meditation gives me anxiety for some reason. So I do tapping because I can focus and relax WAY better. 

I do not consume caffeine or stimulants.

I quit smoking/vaping/nicotine.

Over the course of 6 months I got about 10 vitamin B12 shots. Low B12 contributes to poor melatonin production.

I changed my diet for the purposes of improving my gut microbiome, reducing chronic pain and inflammation, and overall health. I do not know if this helped my sleep but I do personally feel like it played a part in helping my sleep. No grains, no sugar (except 2 - 3 servings of fruit a day) , no dairy. Essentially paleo diet. For 3 months I only ate meat, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans and some fruit. Dramatically reduced my sugar intake. When you consume too much sugar your adrenaline shoots up. Breads and pastas spike your blood sugar and has basically the same effect. If that sounds too intense, consider keto diet where you can still eat butter and cheese. Or, the way I started off was, I just cut out sugar and flour. So I still ate dairy like plain yogurt and milk and grains like rice and oatmeal. Then I progressed to paleo. Now i do relaxed paleo. So I eat a lot of meat and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds, 2 fruits a day, and i'll have grains, dairy and sugar like once every 3 days or something.

I get an hour massage once a month. Fuck it feels good.

And this one, which may be the most important: **journalling**. I know this sounds **fucking stupid** but it is very good for your brain and nervous system to journal. I do it once every two days for 10 - 20 minutes. The key here isn't to write eloquent entries, but rather to get emotions and negative thoughts onto the page. Things that bother you, current stressors, past stressors, anxieties, emotions, dive deep if you can and be extremely honest. Write-out things that are not meant for anyone to read, write our your most raw and horrible thoughts. Let yourself cry if you feel like you need to. If all that's too intense for you to start off with, just write about insignificant things like someone who was rude to you today. Seriously it sounds dumb but it honestly feels like you are getting rid of shit that's stuck in you. Slowly over time you'll notice your mind is going only 1000 miles a minute at bedtime instead of a 10,000 miles a minute. 

And every night before bed I ""talk to my brain"". I know it sounds ridiculous. But i say something like ""I am safe. You are safe. My body is at peace. It is time to rest and I am safe. I love myself."" Lol

And also my thing is falling asleep to 1 - 2 hour youtube videos where its either an interview/podcast show or some teenager talking about some movie lol.

And the very last thing is, once in a while when I do really struggle and the fear that I won't sleep hits me, I take half of a robaxasol (muscle relaxant). 

I truly hope this post wasn't triggering to anyone because I understand there is nothing more frustrating seeing suggestions you've tried that didn't work. Or seeing fluff suggestions like yoga...very annoying. Keep in mind I still have terrible chronic pain and am on disability despite overhauling my entire life trying to get better and putting all of my willpower into my new self-care lifestyle. I couldn't solve my pain but my sleep got so much better and I am grateful for that. 

**TL;DR:** Supplements - magnesium bisglycinate and L-theanine and liquid vitamin D every night, almost daily exercise 15-30 min, almost daily stretch/yoga 10 min, EFT tapping and/or meditation 10 minutes, paleo diet (dramatically reduced sugar intake), massages, journal for 10-20 min once every two days

A lot of it may sound silly but never underestimate the power of calming your nervous system down. By doing the things I discussed you are calming down your nervous system and telling your nervous system that it's safe. Safety = rest & repair.

997,"Clonazepam 1-2 times a week? 1st hand experience ONLY Long story, too much to type here. I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. IF YOU AREN'T SHARING 1ST HAND EXPERIENCE, DON'T POST.

 I hate the idea of a benzo for obvious reasons. YES, I don't need to hear benzo horror stories. 5 months of insomnia and 14 Dr visits, 3 Drs, etc, etc, etc. I've explored everything. 2 Docs suggested this as a possibility. NOT daily use.

I don't need to hear pros and cons for daily use. I WON'T be doing that.

998,"I'm terrified I realized that after reading through posts on /r/insomnia that maybe my problems aren't anywhere near as bad as some others have reported.

I have struggled with always being tired after starting Paxil in 8th grade. The one good news about this was that I could almost always sleep. Naps were a favorite of mine. Over the past few years, things have changed a bit. Napping almost always leads to a bad night of sleep... lots of tossing and turning, perhaps no sleep at all.

For the past year, I haven't felt quite like myself. Couldn't do a full 8 hours of work. Fatigued more than usual. My doctors couldn't find anything wrong until I got a new PCP. She found my vitamin D was low. As soon as I started supplementing the vitamin D, I started getting muscle spasms/twitches/jerks. These happen throughout the day and are disconcerting and annoying.

Recently, I have really been struggling with my sleep. I did a 3 night sleep study at home. No OSA found. I was diagnosed with insomnia with dyssomnia. I barely got any stage N3 sleep because anytime I hit this stage, I started to bounce back and forth between stage N2 and stage N3. At least I am getting REM sleep...

Now, in the past month, I am going on full insomnia cycles. Struggle to sleep for a few nights (maybe 1-5 hours over a span of 3 days), then back to my ""regular"" sleep. I fear that this is all connected. Lack of good sleep means my body is revolting with muscle twitches/spasms/jerks and fatigue. Not to mention my anxiety has been through the roof this year: marriage problems (fighting and talk of divorce), work stress, health stress, my uncle dying from a heart attack, and all of the general worry I have carried around with me since I was a child.

I fear I am going to die from this. I am terrified that I will continue to get worse. I read the posts on here and it gives me a bit of relief, but I suppose I worry because that's all I know how to do. I want to watch my kids grow up and be there for them. Not die because I can't get sleep... Tonight was really hard for me. I got Clonazepam from my psychiatrist and that used to knock me on my ass (9+ years ago) for the anxiety I would struggle with. I couldn't keep my eyes open, even with splitting the pill in half. Tonight? Full dose. Nothing. I took it 2 hours ago and I am wide away at my computer.

Perhaps you all can provide some reassurance for me. My doctors don't know what to do at this stage. They've provided Doxepin, gabapentin, and now clonazepam. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. I had a brain MRI for some vision changes (static field of vision, eye sensitivity) and the muscle spasming but that came back clean. My next stop is getting an EMG nerve test to see why I'm jerking/twitching/spasming, but that's in mid-February.

Any thoughts?",Clonazepam
999,"Disorder unknown Hey everyone, first time posting here!

So I mentioned to my psychiatrist a few months ago that I have some type of sleep disorder. I explained it to her, which completely flabbergasted her. She sent me to a sleep clinic, where I was told that my condition has yet to be identified.
Sleep clinic didn't even perform a sleep study on me, as they said it wouldn't diagnose anything.

The disorder is like this: I'll go to bed at let's say midnight exactly. In exactly 3 hours, I will wake up completely and be very wired.
Let's say I go to bed at 10pm, I will then proceed to wake up at 1am exactly. It's always exactly 3 hours.

Now it didn't start this way, this disorder suddenly occurred during the summer of 2019 and I got exactly 5 hours of sleep each night with no exceptions. 
About 12 months ago from today, it shortened to just 4 hours each night.
These last few months are where I'm at now with my current allowance of 3 hours per night.
As you can see, this condition is progressively getting worse.

Along with this sudden onset disorder during 2019, I also developed severe hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). I also lost the ability to regulate my body temperature appropriately.
When I get a little warm, my body quickly ramps up heat until I'm melting and begin profusely sweating.
It's very rare I get too cold, but when it happens I violently shake/shiver. Typically I'll walk around in the dead of winter with nothing more than a t-shirt....and I'll begin sweating.....even in below freezing temps.

So my psychiatrist of course thought she could help me with the sleeping aspect of this condition. She has prescribed me a bunch of different sleep aids.

I've been on all of these without success:
-Seroquel, -Remeron, -Lunesta, -Clondine, -Clonazepam, -Doxepin, -Risperidone.

Nothing works to extend sleep beyond 3 hours.
I fall asleep very easily.
I eat incredibly healthy + I'm highly active.
I don't drink or do recreational drugs.
I practice great sleep hygiene.

So I got to thinking about my situation today, been dealing with this for over 2.5 years now.
I remembered reading up on some medical literature years ago about a condition called 
""Fatal familial insomnia"".
I looked into it today and I have most of the symptoms. No I'm not a hypochondriac.

It's an incredibly rare, terminal genetic disorder. It affects fewer than 40 families around the world. There are some cases which emerge in random people with no family history of this condition. (Yes, it runs in families). 
This condition causes progressively worsening insomnia, which eventually leads to a permanent inability to fall asleep. This inability to sleep leads to dementia, coma and death. No cure, no treatments.

So what do you all think? I am not asking for medical advice, but what is your opinion on my issue?
Does it sound like something else?
I mentioned my concern to my psychiatrist in an email today, she has yet to respond.
Diagnosis is either difficult or impossible for this disorder, as a confirmation is done post-mortem.",Clonazepam
1000,"Anyone had success with hydroxyzine? I’ve tried everything at this point—Zopiclone, Trazodone, Clonazepam, Methotrimeprazine, and other various benzos and antipsychotics. The only thing that has worked so far is 200mg Seroquel. Unfortunately, I started getting a strange rash that appears about 30 minutes after I take my Seroquel, so we’re thinking I’ve developed an intolerance to it or something. My psychiatrist and I are looking for other options and he ended up prescribing 50mg hydroxyzine last week. I’ve taken it for 7 days now and seems to make me a teeny bit drowsy but nothing like Seroquel. It’s also been giving me vivid dreams and I’ve been waking up multiple times a night in a cold sweat. And I’ve been REALLY insatiably hungry!

I met with him again today and he suggested that I up the dose to 100mg and try that for a week. Between the lack of effectiveness at 50mg and the side effects I’m not feeling so hopeful about this drug. So I’m just wondering:

- Did hydroxyzine work for you? 
- Did you have these side effects, and did they ever go away? 


I’m especially interested in answers from people who have trialed a lot of other meds with little success.

I want to try Lexapro again but this fear is keeping me from doing so and keeping me from treating my anxiety disorder. I just wish I knew what is causing this hyperarousal and sleep onset insomnia.

In July 2019 I found it harder to fall asleep and remain asleep. In August 2019 I went 5 days without sleep and went to the emergency department in my country's hospital.  

They referred me to the country's mental asylum (which is officially the worst mental health hospital in all of Europe - google the name ""mount carmel hospital malta"") and they started me on 7.5mg olanzapine.

I haven't felt sleepy since August 2019.  

Every 3 months, my insomnia worsens, like clockwork. It got worse 2 days ago. In the past this wasn't an issue, because my doctor would just increase the dosage of the olanzapine by 5mg (olanzapine  and mianserin seem to be the two medications that seems to do anything, the others I consider ""cosmetic"").  

But now I am on the maximum prescribable dose of olanzapine and I can't fall asleep anymore. I have illegally bought a couple of boxes of olanzapine so I can overdose to 30mg (the government gives me all of my medication for free but dispenses exact amounts for every two months, except for the trazodone, which I have to buy).  

I earn very little and olanzapine is an expensive medication, as is trazodone, but those are the least of my worries. In another 2-3 months time my insomnia will progress again and I will be sleepless for good!

1016,"I suffer from complete intractable insomnia that can only be alleviated by a massive cocktail of meds. I am planning to break the world record of longest time without sleep by not taking my meds. So, a little background:  

In March/April 2018 I starting getting a relentless hacking cough in the evenings only. It would mysteriously disappear in the mornings and then reappear at around 7 pm/8 pm. A month or two later, I started experiencing absolutely excruciating sternum pains, that would slowly build-up, and then crescendo just under my sternum, deep within my chest. I would also get horrible generalized inflamed muscular pain in my back and shoulder blades. Oftentimes, it would also be painful to stand up, as my feet would hurt like mad. The terrible sternum pain would trigger depending on what position my body lay in, and oftentimes would wake me from sleep.  

After about 17 months of this pain and misery, in August 2019, I lost the ability to sleep. In July 2019 I noted in my journal that I was sleeping less, waking up often during sleep, but didn't really give it much thought at the time. Come August 8th, 2019, I totally lost the ability to sleep. I went to the emergency department after 4 or 5 days without sleep, they took a CT scan of my brain, found nothing wrong, and[ sent me to one of the worst psychiatric hospitals in the world.](https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/hell-at-mount-carmel-isolated-in-cell-with-thin-mattress-and-squat.846717)  

After another 3 days of not sleeping there, they administered me 7.5mg of a powerful atypical antipsychotic called Olanzapine (trade name Zyprexa).   
  

Fast forward to today... I now am prescribed:  

* 20mg olanzapine (I illegally overdose by 10mg to get restful sleep, so I take 30mg)  
* 1.5mg risperidone (I illegally overdose by .5mg and take 2mg)  
* 90mg Mianserin (trade name Tolvon)  
* 75mg clomipramine  
* 2mg Clonazepam (trade name Rivotril)  

  
 On this insane cocktail of medication, I get a broken 4 hours of sleep. The point I am trying to make is, my insomnia is constantly ""progressing"". The most powerful and effective medicines that put me to sleep are the Olanzapine and the Mianserin, but I am prescribed the maximum dose of both of those medications. If my doctor finds out I am overdosing on the Olanzapine, I'll get locked up in the mental hospital for 10 weeks. (I have what's called a National Treatment Order signed against me, because of a video I once uploaded threatening suicide if the doctors didn't cure my insomnia. I have since deleted that video).  

I've documented my journey on my youtube channel, starting from when I first believed I had FFI all the way up to the present day when I obviously don't believe that to be the case any more (I had genetic testing done.)  

Unfortunately, during the period of time that I thought I had FFI, I shot myself in the foot, and now all the neurologists on the island don't take me seriously and have brushed off my insomnia as anxiety. I firmly believe my insomnia to be organic in nature, but my country doesn't have the equipment to do the necessary test (SPECT scan, neurotransmitters tests) and even if they did, the pool of neurologists in Malta (there are very few, we have a population of 450,000 or thereabouts) would refuse me the tests.

So, I have come to a crossroads, and have decided to make a difficult decision:

I want to live stream (on Youtube, probably, as all I have is a Xiaomi Pocophone F1) my journey of not taking my medication and proving to the world and my medical team that[ I have absolutely no natural sleep drive](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock#:~:text=Sleep%2Fwake%20homeostasis%20balances%20our,and%20our%20sleep%20drive%20diminishes.).  

To explain my insomnia simply, I haven't felt ""sleepy"" (just utterly exhausted) since July 2019. I do not yawn, I do not ever feel groggy, my eyes never get heavy and hard to keep open, and require ***phenomenal*** amounts of medication in order to sleep.

I'm planning to get the live stream going in mid-October, I haven't settled on a date yet. Anyways, the aim is to break the world record of no sleep.  

I would also be very interested to hear if anyone else on this sub takes similar amounts of medication to sleep, and also has no ""sleep drive"".  

Thanks for reading the long post!",Clonazepam
1017,"Insomnia? More like acute sleep deprivation for me... Glad to find this Reddit ... I suffer from clinical, acute sleep deprivation disorder. It's no laughing matter. People who haven't been through it, simply cannot comment or even comprehend. Every month or so, I'll have an episode which will (and I kid you not) see me completely sleepless from upwards of 5 to 9 days at a time. 9 days being the worst. Generally, it's in the 6 to 7 day range. 

This is non psychiatric, meaning there is nothing bugging me, eating at my conscience or otherwise worrying me. I don't do drugs of any kinds (except for the sleep meds my doc gives me), certainly no stimulants of any kind and I stay active throughout the week. Though exhausted to the point of not really even being able to drive safely, the sleep mechanism as I tend to describe it, just never kicks in. 

It's difficult to describe to people what being awake for 9 days is like: complete loss of equilibrium, like I said, driving is utterly terrifying and just bending over without \*falling\* over is a real challenge. Speaking becomes immensely difficult. Hallucinations are constant. Simple math is almost impossible. Walking, even, is a supreme challenge. And personally, at the six day point and on to 7 and 8 and 9 days, I hallucinate intensely and suffer from incredibly real/vivid delusions. Complete loss of identity. 

One particularly bad episode had me flying to New York for a swank party with a famous blogger I'm a fan of (all in my mind of course) ... it was as real as anything you could imagine. This was not transitory or passingly hallucinatory, these events seemed as real as any real experience can be. I even told my bewildered family members about it the next morning, still thinking it happened, ""Hey, I went to a kick ass party in New York last night!"" etc. Knowing my pattern, though, my affliction ... they didn't worry too much about it. 

These things culminate into an eventual shut down and I will then get about 8 hours sleep and whalla! I'm back to normal. But it's utterly terrifying when it happens. The nights lying there will see me awash with the worst anxiety imaginable, wondering how I will make it through the day and if some delusion will take hold and if I'll make an arse of myself. The days are even more anxiety ridden as I'm terrified of the coming night and what terrors it might hold. Just looking at my bed inspires panic attacks. 

My doctor has me on 1mg Clonazepam nightly and this helps tremendously at times but during ""episodes"" it does nothing. I've also found that combining the 1mg Clonazepam with 6mg melatonin furthers the effectiveness ... I've referred to it among fellow sufferers as ""the golden ratio"" ... anyway ... nice to find this reddit and gush a bit. Sleep well, everybody ... ;-)",Clonazepam
1018,"Clonidine backfires ? (brain chemistry help needed lol) Hi guys. I am on escitalopram 10mg and clonazepam 4mg for a while now (plus magnesium bisglycinate and inositol), but this combo doesn't seem to stop me for being anxious just before sleep. Every night I have to listen to a lot of meditation vids on youtube to finally sleep, and this sucks.

Then a couple of days ago I remembered how Clonidine made me sooo relaxed when I took it, then I tried to use it again (0.150mg) but it seems to be doing the opposite.. I don't feel relaxed at all and it seems to make me wake up out of nothing at 4am or 5am with headaches... then I sleep again but the rest of the day I feel weird & sleepy like I when I don't sleep enough (8h)

In theory, Clonidine seems to be a problem solver for insomnia and anxiety as it makes the brain reduces the noradrenaline/norepinephrine firing... or this assumption is wrong? Do we need noradrenaline to rest/sleep ????

I’ve been talking 0,25mg for a bit less than two weeks and I’ve now been prescribed hydroxyzine. I know that tapering isn’t considered necessary because of how small the dose is and cause I haven’t taken it for that long but I would still like to do it because I’m prone to a reaction.

1020,"Don't know how to help girlfriend deal with insomnia The title of the post pretty much sums it up. She's suffered from this since she was 15 and she's now 27. It's the type of thing that peaks its head up periodiodically and throws her into an even more vicious cycle of anxiety than she's already used to, but the fear of sleeping is always there for her. At the moment, she takes clonazepam and somit (basically the South American brand for ambien) to calm her anxiety and make her drowsy before sleeping, but sometimes that doesn't even work (she's slept a total of 2 hours the past couple days even with taking more than her normal dose of the medication)! We thought that smoking weed in the evenings might be the cure after the times it seemed to work like a charm but then BOOM, it joins the ranks of the other medications that have not provided a lasting or even an effective enough short-term solution. We honestly don't know what to do anymore, and it's gotten to a really unsustainable point. She's tried relaxing before bedtime with a routine of yoga and lit candles and whatnot, which I think has certainly helped but only really works in conjunction with the medication. Whenever she thinks she has her sleep routine more under control, she starts lowering the dosage, and even has successfully slept without it a day here or there! But the insomnia always seems to come back with a vengeance and throw her life into disorder. One additional point that may provide some insight is that she ties this all back to the experience of being bullied by a group of high school friends when she was 15 - supposedly that's when her insomnia first started. Anyways, thoughts/suggestions/advice/opinions/whatever anyone wants to share is welcome. We're really open to anything we can try at this point.",Clonazepam
1021,"Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety and tons of drugs Hello, I have a close friend in another country who needs some help that he’s not getting at home.  His medical problems started about seven years ago with insomnia which snowballed into myriad other afflictions, many of them side-effects of the medications: depression, anxiety, muscle pain/weakness, persistent nausea/vomiting, total lack of appetite, ED and suicidal ideation.  He and his doctors have tried an astonishing array of drugs (detailed below) but have made no progress in treating his insomnia and the other problems reduce his quality of life to near-zero.  To complicate things further, an unfortunate family situation routinely serves to make things worse.

&#x200B;

I’m posting here today because we’re hoping to find: 

\- medical professionals who don’t believe that the answer is “more drugs”

\- other individuals struggling, recovering or recovered from similar circumstances

\- recommended courses of action

\- facilities or support organizations with relevant expertise 

&#x200B;

As his friend, I believe that his doctors at home (in a country with public healthcare) have neither the resources nor the incentives to make him better, and so their efforts to medicate him are more about stabilization than recovery.  In other words, I believe that his doctors have basically given up.  I will not.  We eagerly welcome anything positive that this community has to offer.  Thank you.

1022,"I haven't felt sleepy once since getting a nerve block - addicted to benadryl 3 months ago I got a Stellate Ganglion Block as a last resort for treatment resistant depression. My body reacted very badly to the procedure and had intense anxiety and anhedonia for weeks afterwards. Those effects gradually went away, but my sleep has remained altered. 

Before the block I had no problem sleeping, I often slept too much and felt fatigued often. But since getting the SGB procedure, I haven't once felt sleepy or fatigued, even after not sleeping for one or two days. I don't have anxiety, or racing thoughts, or any mental issue preventing me from falling asleep, my nervous system just won't shut off.

The only thing that can put me to sleep is either Diphenhydramine (75mg). If I take Clonazepam with it, I can get by with 25mg of Diphenhydramine. 

I've tried every other sleep aid, melatonin, magnesium, l-theanine, passionflower, etc. Valerian Root will work, but makes me feel terrible the next day.

I need to figure this out before I suffer the consequences from long term diphenhydramine abuse. What can I do?

After exams finished, i was able to sleep maybe 3-4 hours without any meds, until i had another period with 3 days of 0 sleep , this time caused by nothing, not any stressor. I was feeling anxios all day, down, lost interest in all my hobbies and in life in general, feeling like i was not myself. So i decided to go to a psychiatrist. He told that all my feelings are caused by sleep deprivation and once my sleep is on track things will come to normal. So he gave me an Ambien prescription and told me about sleep hygine, waking up and going to sleep at fixed hours, doing some  exercise and getting light in the morning.  I respected all the rules, even tho sleep hygine made me more anxios, i was getting only 3-4 hours of sleep. So i went to another psychiatrist.

2 sleep studies later, CPAP,APAP, MAD and 4 surgeries later(UPPP, epiglotis removal, tongue base advancement and hyoid bone suspension, left side styloidectomy) and it's the same thing.

I'm in a zombie state through the day bc I think I don't get enough deep sleep(N3) or because of the number of arousals, as a rule more arousals => worse in the daytime.

*I have a vibrating tongue base (i think) when i put my head aginst the wall, i feel a rhytmic fast frequency vibrating through my skull, it turns off when my brain is awake, it returns when i'm falling back asleep. I don't know if this is because of the surgeries or it was there before as i recently discovered it bc of the wall amplification, although I sometimes feel it without the wall when i'm awaken.*

My feet also start twiching when i am asleep, (video recorded) the twiches keep increasing in intensity (PLM index was 6.5/hr) and contribute to the arousals.

There is some snoring that happens, i sometimes also wake up with snore sound even though i don't have an epiglotis anymore.

**I think ALL of the above is contributing in waking me up each night, it's like my body switches into WAR MODE.**

medications:

so far Unisom (Doxylemine) is what i rely on to put me to sleep, but it dosen't work for 2 consecutive nights, i think it make me sleep ""through"" all these arousals, so they keep happening but i go back to sleep faster or i don't feel EACH ONE of the arousals like without medication.

2 years ago I tried clonazepam but very rapidly went from 0.25mg to 4 mg in 3 months so I stopped it.

I tried gabapentin --> no help, made me feel worse.Antidepressants like mirtazapine and trazadone  --> increased my limb jerking each time i go to N1 sleep (drifting to sleep) i jerk awake.

Requip and Mirapex lowest dose --> also prevented me to drift to sleep for the first few hours, then as soon as i fall asleep, I jerk awake, my boidy temperature increase and sleepiness becomes less, i have to weait another 20-30 mns to fall back asllep, and cycle is repeated.

Supplements: --> magnesium(all types), taurine, valerian root, all hypnotic herbs, melatonine, etc.. nothing is dependable.

&#x200B;

I was almost finishing my masters 3 years ago, but I could not neither am able to work because of this sleep issue, i can't even apply for disability as it is not ""understood"". **My life has been on PAUSE**.

I have seen COUNTLESS sleep doctors/neurologists/primary care docs and after hearing me, they are cluless, lately foudn a neuro who is willing to try to work with me and recommended the RLS meds (requip/mirapex) but he said if this does not work, the number of medication that might help is very limited..

I know this is the internet, but i'll take any help.

thanks.

1028,"Chronic post Covid insomnia I have never been a big sleeper. I usually slept like 6 ish hours and 8 hours on my good days. I experienced small bursts of insomnia throughout my life, especially during my engineering finals where I had so much to study. It only lasted for a while though, maybe a week. During that time I was prescribed xanax by my doctor and it worked pretty well. I only used it for a week in the past and my sleep schedule resorted back to normal after my exams. I caught covid back in April. I was fine back then. I was fine later too for a month. My covid was mild and did not effect my sleeping pattern much. Fast forwards 2 months post my covid and I'm a mess. I'm suffering from worst insomnia of my life. I was awake for 52 hours straight until chloropromazine 50mg knocked me out. Insomnia made my anxiety worse and I started experiencing panic attacks. I tried seroquel combined with ativan and still couldnt sleep. I was lying awake the whole night. I just feel awful and foggy. My family doctor thought i was depressed post covid and put me on chloropromazine 50mg but it is the shittiest drug out there. I feel so dizzy and absolutely horrible when I'm on it but it made me sleep. I consulted a psychiatrist a few days back and he told me all my problems are due to insomnia post covid and i neither have anxiety nor depression. He gave me clonazepam 1mg every night and its been working okayish. I'm getting 5 hours of sleep max and sleep quality isnt great. I feel okay during the day not like my usual self.

I came across this reddit group and found it useful.
Let me share my problem so that any one of the group member can help me.I am suffering from a strange sleep disorder from the past 7 years.
Exactly what happens is that there occurs a lot of dreams, I mean excessive dreams on daily basis, and when I awake I feel totally exhausted and depressed.
Due this I have developed fibromyalgia and I am living in 24 hours, 7 days in pain.
I have consulted many psychiatrists and I took all antidepressants(ssri,snri), anti-psychotics, mood stablizers, but I didn't get any relief.
Finally I decided to go for polysomnography, and the EEG report revealed that there is alpha wave intrusion in delta wave sleep or Alpha delta sleep disorder.Though psychiatrist also told me that polysomnography scores are most often not reliable because of so many electrodes placement and even a normal non insomniac person is unable to sleep properly on the night of PSG.
For this I am taking clonazepam .5mg only as prescribed by my psychiatrist and no other medication.But I am getting no relief.
I am unable to recognise whether I am having excessive dreams during sleep or I am having excessive thoughts in delta sleep.I don't have any problem in initiation or maintenance of sleep.
I have cool, peaceful and silent room to sleep.
I am not obese.I don't have any type substance abuse.
I have tried mindfulness meditation.
I have tried yoga.I tried aerobics.I have tried alternative medicines.I have tried everything you name.
Problem lies is altered sleep structure.
Due to all this, my everyday passes in pain and I can no longer tolerate the pain.Some times I think of suicide but I will never do it as my inner conscience prohibits to do so.I have to take ibuprofen with paracetamol on daily basis to ease my pain and I know it will affect my kidney.

Migraines tend to make me sleepy. Otherwise my sleep has been little and super broken. I feel like I only slept maybe an hour last night even though I tried sleeping alone and with meditative tracks.

1040,"It was stronger than me. Dear friends, brothers, sisters.

Some of you have probably read my previous posts and I thank you all of you from the depth of my heart for all the words of encouragement you gave me.

At this point in my life I can't no longer function without benzodiazepines, more specifically clonazepam.

My addiction started 23 years ago when I was a teen. I stayed sober for 8 months and 17 days. I believe that all the trauma that I sufferred as a child and as a teenager changed and damaged my brain permanently. Clonazepam is the closest thing I have that allows me to live a normal life.

I compare myself to someone that will need insuline for the rest of his life, or to someone suffering from HIV that will need to take anti-viral drugs for the rest of his life.

Life is what it is. I plan to enjoy every second of my life from now on with the most precious person of my life, my beloved wife.

I wish I could muster the strengh to keep sober, but I can't. Maybe I'm weak, maybe I just want to enjoy the present moment.

For the past year I tried Ayahuasca, Mushrooms in microdose, exercise, long walks, health eating, suplements, talk therapy. I believe that I have really tried everything in my power.

Last night I could finally fall asleep like a baby and relax. Today I went to the supermarket and drove around and things were not irritating me like they used to. I feel like a normal person.

I'll be on benzos for the rest of my life. This is my decision and I take full responsibility for it. My wife consented to my decision too and reaffirmed her love for me. We will be together until the end.

Hopefully some 20 or 30 years for now our scientists will be able to fix the brain and its multiple disorders.

Lastly, I'm not encouraging anybody to follow on my steps. I just felt it would be fair to share this with all of you, considering my previous posts.

Follow your heart and choose what you feel is right for you.

Peace.",Clonazepam
1041,"Benzo's for insomnia? 

I've not taken benzo's for about a year but recently my insomnia has become unbearable. I thought Clonazepam with no telerance would help but I've taken 12mgs over the space of 5hours and I fell wide awake, energetic even. I hear people falling asleep from 0.5-1mg so this is really frustrating. I guess I choose the wrong benzo and should have done more research but I thought after not taking any for so long that they woukd work.

Any suggestions? I've tried Magnesium and Bacopa but also no success. And Mirtazapine was prescribed for depression which had the best effect of knocking me out but I was so groggy the next day I would not be able to get out of bed. This is related to depression. I know this sounds like I'm exagerrating but insomnia is making my life hell when I also have to work.

What would you recommend for insomnia? Zopiclone? Temazapam? I tried GBH but even that didn't work. I'm so desperate I may try get hold of Rohypnol.

Also important to add that I'm in the UK which is at the opposite extreme of the US by very rarely prescribing benzo's.I feel like this constant lack of sleep is going to kill me and benzo;s, despite knowing how dangerous they are, are they only way out.

Please any advice will be appreciated and thoroughly read and taken on board.

1042,"Intractable insomnia for 19 months Sex: Male Race: Caucasian Height: 5'6 Weight: 70kg (natural weight before I started taking medication was 58kg) Duration of complaint: 19 months  

Hi all. This is an introductory post that I'm leaving here to see if anyone has experienced anything similar.  

Starting July 2019, I started getting interrupted sleep. By August 2019 I started suffering from total insomnia and went 7 days without sleep. Went to the emergency department at hospital and referred me to one of the worst places in Malta: Mount Carmel Mental Hospital. They administered olanzapine 7.5mg, which was enough to put me to sleep at the time. The jerks and spasms stopped. Fast forward to February 2021 and I'm now on:  

800mg quetiapine (seroquel)  
100mg clomipramine  
3mg clonazepam  
40mg olanzapine (zyprexa)  
60mg mianserin  

and I get 5-6 hours of light sleep.

The doctors want me to come back to the mental hospital (where there are many cases of COVID) to try a new drug, Clozapine. I've currently got 3 tattoos that are healing so I can't afford to go back to that hellhole of a hospital right now. In the very near future I will have to end up going, however, as my prescribed doses of medicine (which are slightly less than what I listed above) are no longer getting me to sleep.  

  When I try to sleep without medicine, I get jolts, spasms, gasps, and I grin and grimace involuntarily. This illness has totally destroyed my life.. Ruined relationships with my friends, ruined my career (I'm still working otherwise I'm homeless if I lose my job) and has made me suicidal. I've never met anyone who takes as much medicine to sleep as I do. Anyways, I wish everyone here the best of luck. I think my days are numbered.",Clonazepam

1046,"Need some kind of sleeping medication due to chronic insomnia, but have run out of options for things to try, what medication options can I still try? (desperate and scared) To make a long story short, I've suffered with a sleep disorder for 15 years now. Despite immense amount of testing/studies, the experts aren't sure what I have, with the best guess being a type of the REM sleep behavior disorder. The one thing that was still going for me was I was able to fall asleep pretty much right away, that is, until a very traumatic event in Oct 2018. Since then I've suffered from worsening chronic insomnia, in addition to severe anxiety, depression, and stress due to many real life situations and being in a very bad spot in life for the past 2+ years.

Since the Oct 2018 event, I've needed sleep medication to get to sleep. Unfortunately things have worsened and the things that were at least kind of working no longer are, or have major side effects where I can't take them anymore. I don't know what to do or what to try anymore. Here's what I've tried (PS: I would have already tried marijuana if it was legal in WI, but it's not, thank you backwards ass government):

&#x200B;

* Ambien / Zolpidem IR and ER: I'm at the max 12.5 dosage and it only gets me slightly tired and lasts 3-4 max, I'm then wide awake
* Remrom / Mirtazapine: Had some effectiveness, but caused severe weight gain in a very short amount of time each time I tried it. I'm talking 10-15 pounds in 2-3 weeks. I couldn't fit into clothes I normally could anymore.
* Klonopin / Clonazepam: Also the 'gold standard' for REM sleep behavior disorder, but not effective for me. Had some insomnia effectiveness in the past, but recent trials on it caused me to have severe panic attacks. It also seems to have caused morning panic attack or restless leg syndrome in the past month where I wake up around 6 and can't get back to bed because I HAVE to move my legs.
* Catapres / Clonidine: Made me slightly groggy but didn't help me stay asleep. Recently it seems to actually have interrupted my REM sleep as it seemed I would wake up every time I was about to dream and continue having constant wakeups at night.
* Desyrel / Trazodone: Slightly worked but also had an allergic reaction to it even in relatively low doses which caused my nose to plug up and difficulty breathing.
* Seroquel / Quetiapine IR: Same issue as Trazodone only much more severe. Had issues at 100mg and the first night I took it at 200mg I nearly had to call an ambulance because it closed up my throat where I had to stay sitting up until started to wear off as otherwise I'd asphyxiate myself.
* Melatonin: Tried various mg amounts. Causes lots of weird dreams, but does almost nothing to get or stay asleep.
* Diphenhydramine: Apparently I'm one of those who it doesn't work on. Barely has any effect if at all.",Clonazepam

1048,"New To Trazodone - Side Effects, Treatment Success Questions Hi Everyone,

So I've developed major insomnia, possibly from clonazepam withdrawal after 10-12 years of use.  But I began tapering off in 2018.  Took roughly a year to get off drug.  Went through major withdrawal symptoms.  Late last year and early this year (2020), I was able to sleep fine.  But this summer, boom!  Insomnia just attacked me hard.  A few doctors have told me it's just anxiety in my subconscious mind.  Anyway, IDK.  But I can't sleep.  Now they want me to take this Trazodone med.   


I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP.  That's been ruled out, after checking the data, stats, etc.  So, basically my brain is screwed up (chemical imbalance).  Has anyone here had any success with this drug, particularly with those who use a CPAP?  What kind of side effects have you experienced with Trazodone?",Clonazepam
1049,"New. Hello all! I'd like to open a free discussion among us regarding withdrawel symps from common Rx'd solutions to counteract Insomnia: One are Benzodiazepins (ie. Valium, Cloneazepam, Alorazepam) the other subject is ""Z"" class sleep drugs (ie. Zopiclone aka Imovan Zolpidem aka Ambiem) To begin, a bit about myself.  I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 , AD\[H\]D, Depression, Anxiety, as well as Chronic Insomnia.

For Bipolar 2 I am medicated with 200mg Seroquel XR and Divalproex 500mg shortly before bedtime.

For AD\[H\]D I am medicated with 36mg \*brand name Concerta XR (aka IR Ritalin) In the Morning

For Depression I am medicated with 20mg Fluoxetine (Prozac) shortly before bed

For Anxiety I am medicated with 0.25mg Clonazepam in the morning

For Insomnia I am medicated with 0.5mg Clonazepam, 75mg Seroquel (IR) and 7.5mg Zopiclone -- my other night time meds are supposed to help with these two in getting me asleep

I know neither Z drugs or benzos should be taken for prolonged times, though that being said I have been on Zopiclone for atleast 4 years now at this moment.  Benzos I have been on for around years now.

&#x200B;

It has been a long time since i have had a medication change, and I am wondering if I should request a change.

Since this is an insomnia forum I will stick to those issues.

I have as of recently been having trouble and concerns regarding my medication.  I pose this question to you all, could my medication-tolerance finally caught up to me? My doctors have NOT increased ANY of my medication along the years.  I can clearly feel a difference in how they influence me now.

&#x200B;

The CLoneazepam is just a little too weak; It is a sedative but in my case its used to cease my anxiety before bed.

Zopiclone is the interesting one now.  And I am not quite sure how to word it appropiately but It feels as if I now ""feel like my self"" while on Zopiclone sometimes.  My mind during these periods are the only time I see my common actions as not trying as hard as i should at life. Sometimes the Zopiclone can make me feel like my old self before all of my mental issues.       it would appear to cure my anxiety and depression simutaniously and actually do enjoyable things.

\----------> Would I have a chance of asking for a revision of my medications from my psychiatrist?

\---------> Could there be a medication which could work similar to Zopiclone but not make the user drowsy?  One of my doctors has suggested Gabapentin in the past.

\------------> I know

\--------> I have infact tried both gabapentin and pregabelin before and both helped a bit (though I know finding ones which have good chemistry with you is difficult.

I am a recent Uni grad living back at home since April or so.  During covid I have just stayed home and helped my family ( a few of my family members are more at risk than average people) Though. All I am doing is collecting from Ontario Disability.  But I cant stand this stagnent lifestyle.  I'd so like to just overcome this depression or inbalence of chemicals in my brain.

I am I am almost ready to fully try to integrate back into society but If I cannot get a revisions of all my prescriptions , increases, decreases, etc etc. I know my self and I will just go right into the same slump eventually.

&#x200B;

Even if only one person comments here, I'd be really grateful.  I know my mind may seem all over the place right now but i am currently in the predicament of where me on my zopiclone actually makes me feel normal again.  And is just so difficult and hard to explain to my psychiatrist.  I know for a fact it is not proper to use Zopiclone during the day - so i always try not to, but it doesnt work at night all the time either.  IT used to put me asleep and keep me asleep, but now my sleep schedule has been whack, 6am > 4pm or 4am > 4pm.  I KNOW I am sleeping too much right now. I KNOW what I am doing is contratictory to getting good.

\------> My hope is this can be understood by others.  I havent been doing anything much ""valuable"" during when I am awake, I can't even think right I just do the same day in and out and THAT MUST STOP.  So YES I have been sleeping more hours now to atleast have some excitement and socializing, even if its only in a silly dream.

\-------> IS there a reason Z drugs , like benzos both go to GABA receptors, add the same effect?  If so I have veen on Benzos for nearly 6 years now with no medication upgrades to deal with growing tolorance to the drug.  I am a little worrried about this as I know even a year of benzos is NOT GOOD but 6 YEARS , now that really cant be good.

Ok so here we go the long post from my frantic insomniac brain :) ❤️


     For just about 2 years I don’t sleep every night, it’s every 4-6 nights consistently no sleep at all not even 30min. Meaning I don’t sleep for between 4-6days. When I do fall asleep though, doesn’t matter if it’s a 5 min sleep or 8 hours when I wake up the my body thinks its had a full rest and the no sleep cycle restarts again. (I’ve had insomnia since puberty but never like this)

   ▪️example:I had been up for days and was on my way home from a road trip(in passenger seat NOT DRIVING) and I guess the nice motion of driving made me fell asleep. Well my boyfriend not knowing how serious of a sleep problem I have woke me up to ask if I wanted a drink (I wasn’t thirsty and wasn’t mad because he didn’t know how bad it was) but I had only been asleep for 1.5 hours. My body took that 1.5 hours as full rest and the no sleep cycle has started again and since it’s almost 7am as I’m typing this, that’s 6 nights no sleep onto day 7 no sleep) 

Usually when I finally sleep after x amount of days, I sleep for 10-14 hours. 

I’ve seen my doc(GP) aug 11th and a psychiatrist months ago, explaination why below(he was useless, and said awful things to me *written below in the crooked psychiatrist section lol*, when I’m ready to try again I’ll search for a new psych) But LUCKILY my GP was able to speak with my partner and he explained how  I legitimately do not sleep even an hour during the massive insomnia bouts.

💛🗯may want to start reading again here if you’re still reading 🗯💛

Just wanna start with if my GP and her receptionist hadn’t taken me a seriously or taken the time to listen fully for the first time, I’d have killed myself 100%💘❤️

My insomnia has gotten out of control. I practice extremely good sleep hygiene and I finally called my GP having a full on panic attack on the 11th. I hadn’t slept in so long I was unable to eat, brushing everywhere for no reason and constantly vomiting and I had/still kind of have 0 control over my emotions. What should make me happy makes me yell and what should make me yell makes me laugh. 

She prescribed me an original dose of 10mg Valium but if needed I could take 20mg and the max dose of zopiclone (15mg) Valium as needed/zops at night with the option to mix the zoo and Valium. She also added Effexor to see if it would help after cipralex made me want to kill everyone and Zoloft seemed to have no effect. 

But the Valium/zop mix isn’t working. It worked the first night after 25-30mg Valium,can’t remember exactly) and 15mg zops and I slept from about 1am till 4pm it was glorious!(the 11th because I was so exhausted and malnourished I just needed sleep) but Im struggling falling asleep and staying asleep on day 2 of taking the meds. like I mentioned at the top, and it being 740am my time i feel like I got that one night of sleep and even with pills,even taking more of them I’ll get no sleep at all for 4-6 days. I have no intentions of trying to get high on Valium or zops, or taking anymore than i already have, I have weed and shatter for getting buzzed I just want to be able to relax for 10 min and sleep for 4 hours straight. 

When I took the zop + trazadone mixture in the past I defs slept but for upwards of 12 hours because of the trazadone so that doesn’t work. I was also taking the propanolol with just trazadone for about 2 weeks but it didn’t help me sleep it just slowed my heart down to where I wasn’t sure it was beating 😂🔶

I am 99% sure my insomnia is now related to uncontrollable anxiety/ptsd from a past relationship/awful childhood

I know I NEED type of therapy, pills won’t fix me forever, maybe not at all. But the experience I had with the psychiatrist was awful and I’m not in the right mind frame to try any kind of therapy currently, I’ll just scream. I want to find a new psychiatrist asap but id like my anxiety 5-10% under control so I’m able to sit there and talk without screaming/crying or just leaving.. I want the help, at 27 I’m finally ready for the help and go listen and take the advice of the professionals, but only the ones that are going to keep their follow ups and not be condescending. I’ll get over it soon and begin the hunt :)

Sleeping issues :
I have MAJOR issues falling asleep, 50% of the time if I can get to sleep I’ll stay sleeping but the other 50%  I’m awake every hour or two, sometimes more. If I continue to push myself to fall asleep I will relive really awful flash backs, it’s like my body knows it’s getting into bed but it knows it can’t sleep so it causes massive ptsd like symptoms in me.  I also have only had dream since I was 19, I’m 27 now it’s always the same and it’s a bit scary I don’t know if it matters. 

I’m doing my search online at sleeping meds, but I’m just looking for personal experiences. Like I said, I have a GP who is on my side and understands how seriously my sleep problem is so plz don’t tell me to go to a doctor. Addictive meds are ok for now, no opioids though. I have built trust with my doctor that I can have a benzo or a muscle relaxant and not abuse them, they don’t even get my high anyways I have too much anxiety 😂 so after a lot of honesty and crying with my doc she’s ready to help me as much as she can until we together find the right psych for me. 


Another edit, my brain is melting : it’s almost like I need a magical pill that will put me to sleep, no matter what like you ingest the pill while you’re in bed or laying down because it’s going to put you out and last in my system for between 6-8 hours then I’ll either keep naturally sleeping or wake up but that’s still more than enough sleep. 

Plz believe me when I say I don’t want these sleeping pills forever. I just want something that works while I find a psychiatrist/counsellor/someone to talk to that can help start making a dent in my trauma or whatever you wanna call it.

🔸🔳🔲ABOUT THE CROOKED PSYCHIATRIST/skip if you want 👉👇
#1 THIS PSYCHIATRIST WASNT CHOSEN BY ME OR REFERRED BY MY DOC! My family chose him(why they did 2 paragraphs down) and said they’d pay(this guy is free with Canadian health care) so nice gesture but a little redundant 
#2 I just didn’t want to argue so I waited the unbelievable period of time(9.5months) to see the asshole (suffering horribly the whole wait)

-I should add I have uncontrollable anxiety, I live at a 9/10 all the time no matter the situation, that’s why I saw the psych, my GP understandably said my issues were out of her realm of knowledge but she would support me always. (the insomnia and anxiety are separate issues, they didn’t start at the same time but now they probably fuel each other.) I’m guessing this is why he said nothing (meds or therapy) would help. If you can catch your anxiety and try and control it before it’s a 5/10 or more then it’s a lost cause according to him. I’m guessing this is why he said nothing (meds or therapy) would help, I’m constantly way over a 5. 

-How This Psych was chosen🔶🔸—&gt; My grandparents best friends have a grandson who was also a heroin addict and he was seeing this highly recommend psych near where I moved. Sort of a big difference here, he was supported completely during recovery/detox (I mean emotionally learnt coping skills etc, I don’t know their financial situation) I was also addicted to heroin, but I got clean cold turkey locked up in a room by myself completely with no support from anyone so I hold some resentment to my family, never asked them for money or a place to stay I just asked for emotional support.

-My grandparents friends wouldn’t stop going on about how fantastic this therapist was because he was helping the above mentioned addict keep his life together. So because of the great reviews from parents(who may know more about addiction than mine but still not the facts) of an addict (not an actual patient) they decided that’s who I would see, after waiting 8-9 months, that was his wait list, knowing not a single thing about addiction and what works for one may cause the other to run away from help. 

-Of course read all his online reviews, mostly positive, but some extremely negative and I can see why. He is a straightforward honest guy who won’t bullshit you. The kind of therapist you see at the closing end of your therapy. (occupational psychiatrist maybe? I can’t remember) I am at the start of my therapy journey, I’m still not even sure I trust the process 😂 so if my fam had listened to me things maybe could have been different. BUT- I think he also forgets he’s speaking to highly anxious people/extremely depressed people and while expressing the truth is medically necessary, there should be some techniques known my psychiatrists to speak to people like myself without making us panic. 

-He made me feel 500x worse and hopeless than I did going in. After speaking for under 10 min(including intro time, going over previous meds-which he barely did- he said WORD FOR WORD :your anxiety is so severe no medication or therapy will ever help you” and said I need to spend 2 weeks being monitored in a special kind of house to see how bad my anxiety really is? I was livid to say the least. I felt completely insulted and not taken seriously. Taking 2 weeks off to go spend time in a house being watched by someone who doesn’t know me or my anxiety doesn’t sound diagnostically beneficial. 

-So after hearing all that news within a few minutes, As I’m still trying to process everything with no discussion he cut me off every sleeping med I had instantly and my Ativan and my SSRI (all of which was prescribed by the head of psychiatry at a hospital in my home town) he refused refused to prescribe even small dose Ativan/clonazepam/zopiclone to help how awful I’d be feeling as i had been on my original script for almost a year and prescribed me 2 off label anxiety meds that did nothing(topamax,FANTASTIC FOR MIGRAINES/headaches but absolutely crap for anxiety + propanolol - sorry but how do you take a pill 15 min before an anxiety attack. If I had a 15 min warning I wouldn’t be in the position I am right now?) We agreed I would try his way and I booked a follow up appointment 8 weeks later.  The meds he prescribed off label did not make anything worse, but they didn’t make anything better. I became more uncontrollably anxious, unable to leave the house or take care of myself, and began getting very mad at those closest to me who were trying to help, especially my boyfriend I can be awful when the anxiety and sleep deprivation hit. 


I started calling the office about my appointment 7 days before it (because COVID had started, I didn’t know if he did in person still or just over the phone). The second day of calling, I found out that my grandparents friends son had over dosed and died, which was tragic after all the work he’d done.  I called everyday leaving messages, the phone was never answered and no message was ever returned.   
🔸If he’s taking a break from practicing I understand completely, it can’t be hard to lose a patient but honestly he almost lost another one and could lose more by not giving access to refills for what he prescribed.🔶 he is a doctor with responsibility and patients who could be mentally unstable. An email/call by the receptionist)could have informed all us patients with booked appointments they’d need to be moved would have sufficed, (even if they just called all the patients for the next day everyday they’d eventually catch up, there’s many systems that could work$ or even to offer to fax prescriptions that will be needed so no ones off their meds but instead it’s like he left the planet and myself and others don’t have the meds we need. 

i had no say in what therapist I saw, I live in Canada most are covered, but at this point I’ll pay for help no problem* 🔲🔳🔸

TL/DR- insane insomnia, incompetent psychiatrist that screwed me + prescriptions I’ve tried- I’m asking what sleep meds worked well for you and why or what didn’t work? I talk about anxiety a lot, but I have the Valium for now but I feel the anxiety will get better once I sleep more than once a week  -doesn’t matter if they are an addictive sleeping pill, it will come from my doctor who will know how to handle the tapering down when I get into therapy and start getting better hopefully. 😂

1059,"Sleep deprivation induced hallucinations Hello, sorry this is so long, this is my first post here after discovering this sub, I have suffered from insomnia for around 20 years. 

This is incredibly embarrassing and distressing for me to talk about, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I have seen a couple of articles online where people have had hallucinations after lack of sleep, but they seemed to be aware that they were hallucinating, and I truly, truly believed what I was seeing was real  :(

3 days ago I had been awake for 72 hours. I was convinced that there were fish swimming out from under my floor, and that there was a snake in a plastic bag in my living room. I actually took a video on my phone of this and sent it to a friend and my mother - just thinking about this makes me cringe. I actually called the police to get rid of the snake because I was so terrified, they came out and obviously no snake. I assumed it had moved elsewhere in my apartment. 

The police asked me about my mental health and then left. They then had apparently called paramedics, who checked me over and asked me the mental health screening questions like the date, year, who the prime minister is etc. I was convinced at that point that the snake was on one of the sofas in my living room, and after they left I could see it clearly - a HUGE snake, if I made a noise it would react, it was slowly opening and closing its mouth...I wasn't scared by this but wouldn't go near it. I even took more photos. I also called the RSPCA to come and get it. They did attend and as soon as they did I couldn't see the snake anymore. They searched my place and found nothing, looked at the photos and said they were not convinced that it was a snake. I was still COMPLETELY convinced at this stage, about 12 hours after I first 'saw' it.

In the meantime, my friend was incredibly worried about me and the texts I was sending her telling her about the snake. I want to smack myself in the face thinking about this now! As I work with her, she spoke with my HR contact and they had a conference call with me, concerned about my mental state. They asked permission to speak with my brother (my next of kin, my parents live abroad). My brother came over after work and searched my place again and told me that he fully believed that I was hallucinating. He told me that he had experienced it too after going several days without sleep. I still insisted it was real. My brother also insisted that I eat something as I'd gone a couple of days without food - I'm severely disabled and can't cook meals when I'm having bad days so have been eating only once a day for a while as I have to depend on meal delivery services. 

That evening I was really scared, believing that there was a snake somewhere in my home. I set up barriers of plastic bags around so I'd hear the snake moving around. Thankfully I fell asleep with the help of some sleeping pills (far too many actually- 350mg diphenhydramine, some clonazepam and mirtazapine). The next day I knew that I'd been hallucinating. I felt so so upset, embarrassed, horrified that so many people were witness to my psychosis episode. 

The paramedics had spoken to my doctor, who is incredibly good and familiar with my problems with insomnia as well as my complex medical history. She is part time though so told them to instruct me to get an emergency telephone consultation as soon as possible. I spoke to a doctor I had never seen before late the day after the hallucinations. He was absolutely horrible, was somehow convinced that I was calling to obtain Tramadol, when in fact I'd been trying to explain my recent medical history since he was unfamiliar with my case. I've been on painkillers long term for a severe back injury. He shouted at me, wouldn't let me speak, and at the end of the call told me he was going to prescribe me Amitryptaline with no explanation. I was very distressed throughout the call and for the rest of the evening in floods of tears. 

Thankfully the next day a GP I've had treatment under before called me and was very kind, she spent about 40mins discussing treatment options (the first call lasted just over 5 minutes). She had obviously read my medical records and hospital correspondence, MRI results etc. She decided that the best option for me is to begin treatment with fentanyl transdermal patches to cope with the chronic pain which contributes to my insomnia. She also explained the Amitriptyline and how it would help, and increased the amount of mirtazapine I take. We also discussed other measures that will possibly help as zopiclone doesn't work for me anymore. 

So, I'm hoping that things will improve,  but I'm still terrified of the hallucinations happening again, and still very tearful and embarrassed about what happened. Last night I began the Amitriptyline and got about 3 hours of sleep. On Monday I begin the fentanyl, and I am both glad that my pain is being taken seriously and apprehensive about taking such a strong painkiller. My brother is coming over today to help with some housework and have lunch with me, so I'm looking forward to having him to speak to. I'd really like to know how common this is though, or if my brain is completely screwed up...I'm so scared of this happening again, it was absolutely real to me, now I can't help but wonder if I can really trust anything that I see!",Clonazepam
1060,"I don't know what this is So I've been having trouble sleeping on and off for about 2 years now? I vaguely remember having trouble sleeping during my teenage years as well but this lack of sleep associated with anxiety, I have noticed only since I joined med school. I have this problem only during exams and it tends to subside once I'm done with the exams. In between exams, it does occur on a few occasions....but those are rare and manageable. 
Ever since lockdown started, it's only been getting worse. I don't mind not sleeping, it's that anxiety and panic that comes with it that annoys me...I either can't fall asleep or I end up waking up after an hour or two. Each time this happens, I can feel my heart thumping and I start crying because I get so scared. It's very hard to be rational during these episodes and I'm trying my best to control it, but it's just getting worse everyday 

And I noticed this started when my grandmother had to be admitted in the hospital and I was the one staying with her the whole time. So my sleep schedule got completely messed up and that's when it started getting this bad. 
I've been trying to get in touch with a psychologist... but I'm just not able to find one willing to spend time to find out what this is. 

A doctor prescribed anti anxiety medication (a combination of clonazepam and propranalol) for 10 days. It didn't help at all...
I don't want to take medication just yet because most of the times, I'm aware of what's triggering my episodes 
But now...I'm not sure what to do. It's just getting worse.

1064,"Cannot stay asleep for the life of me So I’m twenty, and during my teens it was believed that I was narcoleptic, based on my mothers diagnosis and certain symptoms I’d been showing around 15-17. When I was 15 however I had a sleep study done where they figured it was inconclusive due to certain things countering the idea that I was such as inability to fall asleep quick enough.

I have also been diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD, and so they believed if I was narcoleptic than they could just “treat” my ADHD with Vyvanse and I’d probably be okay.

In late 2018, I was putting a youth rehab facility for addiction to meth, cocaine, and MDMA. During the first week I visited my psychiatrist and he out me on 10mg Zopiclone and raised my Vyvanse. 

Fast forward to now, I’m on 15 mg Zopiclone, 1 mg of Clonazepam, and 100 mg of Trazadone, and I can’t stay asleep no matter what I do to help maximize the effects of the drug.

1065,"Sleep Apnea or nighttime panic attack? So I've been suffering from insomnia and unrefreshing sleep for about two weeks now, taking a long time to fall asleep and waking up earlier than usual, not being able to fall back asleep or nap during the day. Average of 4-6 hours of sleep a night (if I'm lucky). Sometimes not even an hour.

Tonight, for the third time in about three months, I had an episode of waking up to intense adrenaline and racing pounding heartbeat. The last time it happened I got so unsettled that I couldn't sleep anything for the rest of the night, but today I was able to fall back asleep. Normally this is happening A LOT when trying to nap during the day. My brain will just jolt me awake when I'm in that ""transition"" from awake to asleep.

So my question is: is this common with Sleep Apnea sufferers? I'm kinda doubting that I could have this condition because I've never snored in my life, I have average weight and this kind of thing never happened before my anxiety started flaring up again these past few weeks. I've been having A LOT of sleep anxiety, insomnia and unrefreshing sleep, making me fatigued the whole day.

And on the off chance that it could be Sleep Apnea, should I be scared of continuing to take my prescribed clonazepam before bed? Could I stop breathing and die in my sleep?

Diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorder (I also suspect undiagnosed POTS because my heart rate is generally high and even higher upon standing).

So I've been suffering from fractured sleep for the past two weeks pretty much. I only get sleepy really late (like 3 or 4 in the morning). And when I finally do lay down to sleep at this time, I just toss and turn for literally hours. Yesterday I managed to get 3 or 4 hours of sleep, today almost none, like an hour and a half at most. Before this, I was already also getting early awakenings and not being able to go back to sleep.

And of course since I have major Health Anxiety, along with generalized anxiety and Panic Disorder, I get worried that my body forgot how to sleep or something. As I type this post in the late afternoon, I don't feel sleepy at all, just drowsy and kinda slightly drunk feeling. If I lay down right now, I won't even be able to nap. It feels like my mind is exausted, but my body is too wired. I get adrenaline surges and random tachycardia along with this (this is pretty constant, already had a full cardiac workup and no heart issues were found).

Does anybody else feel this way? I read and hear that most people when they can't sleep or barely sleep during the night, they'll pretty much get knocked out anytime during the day from the tiredness, but with me it's the opposite. My body just won't let my mind shut off. I'm getting desperate because I feel sleep deprived and can't get any relief, and can't stop thinking about this Sporadic Fatal Insomnia disease, which is making me so scared and even more desperate.

PS: I take 0.5mg Clonazepam daily for my anxiety, as prescribed by my psychiatrist, but it doesn't really help me get sleepy, despite its sedative properties. And because of this covid crisis, I won't be able to get an appointment anytime in the near future to get some proper sleeping meds, so I'm pretty much on my own for the time being.

I'll try to keep it short, and I'd appreciate some input.

Around 2.5 years ago I suffered some 2-3 months of panic disorder. Nothing helped, I was going insane and feeling suicidal, until clonazepam turned out to be the wonderdrug that helped immediately. I used it for a month and quit with no side effects.

Since then, I started feeling fatigued. I'm not sure there is a connection, and initially me and my doc tested other usual causes like vitamins, blood, hormones, etc. After the first year, another symptom kicked in - nocturia. I get up to pee 2-5 times a night. All usual causes for this were investigated too.

Someone suggested these are typical symptoms for sleep apnea, but the test came back negative. I have signed up for hypnogram in a week (measuring my brainwaves and sleep cycles overnight).

Usually I sleep well. Though lately I tend to take up around 3.30 and lie in bed for an hour or so before falling asleep again. If I smoke weed in the evening, that usually doesn't happen. Regardless, that one hour of being awake at night shouldn't have such a drastic effect, right? Or can it?

***so, on to the present*** 


Sorry in advance for what I suspect will be a long post. Just some background stuff I couldn't bring myself to omit.

So just for context: 

I was diagnosed with PTSD-related insomnia at 13 after fighting off an attempted assault. For a few years before that, I had already been struggling with insomnia intermittently due to a fear of sleeping at night (my mother, who was chronically suicidal, often attempted to kill herself at night, and I felt responsible for staying alert in order to thwart her...which did happen more than once when I was young). But the assault really established the insomnia as a chronic problem. Because flashbacks and nightmares and cruel thoughts and general fear. Y'all know the drill.

The insomnia was largely untreated. I tried temazepam, but it didn't help much with sleep and just made me restless and weird (weirder than usual, anyway - I was drawing bizarre things on my walls with no memory of having done so). So instead I used absurd amounts of diphenhydramine/Benadryl every night for about 8 years. The dosage eventually grew to 300+mg every night, just to sleep. Would NOT recommend. The dysphoria at that dose is almost worse than the insomnia...and it can kill you. It  never worked all that well, anyway, but even that stopped working altogether after a while. I was sleeping a little most nights, but not well and not for long. 

Then, almost exactly a decade after the attempted assault that kick-started my insomnia, and because the universe likes to just *mess* with me...I suffered a traumatic brain injury during a second (unrelated) sexual assault while working overseas. Punch in the face, and my skull ricocheted hard against a brick wall.

Unsurprisingly, the brain injury and emotional impact of the attack resulted in more PTSD. That was four years ago and it exacerbated my insomnia so much that I started sleeping only a couple days a week, and never for more than 4 hours at a time. Usually less. My physical and mental health completely tanked. Prescription and OTC drugs and therapy did nothing. Even Ambien was utterly worthless. I was basically a zombie. All the effects from the TBI became unbearable without sleep - especially the headaches, which just made it impossible to rest. I was often hit with sleep psychosis (of varying severity).

But even with the insomnia, the panic attacks, the psychosis, and the cognitive deficits, my sleep problems had never put me in the hospital. 

For tangential context on that, in case anyone is wondering why a clearly psychotic person bordering on a crisis wouldn't go the ER: 

My mother has always had a lot of severe mental illness, including frequent psychotic episodes. My dad, on the other hand,  is an MSW, a counselor with a degree in psychology, and works at an involuntary in-patient psych facility. So my mom's erratic behavior feels normalized enough in our house that we're maybe a bit desensitized. And the symptoms of sleep psychosis aren't wildly different from the usual symptoms of my own panic disorder/PTSD/TBI/depression/bipolar II, so it can be tough to spot. Even when it happens to me and it's obvious, my Dad is there to provide help and guidance. We know he shouldn't treat family members, but he can still give advice and monitor me when I snap.

***So, on to the present.***

I was admitted to the ER on Saturday with a severe panic attack after four days without sleep. I was mildly delusional, hyperventilating, very sure that I was dying, badly dehydrated, and registering a pulse above 140 BPM. I have panic attacks almost every night and some of them are pretty serious (the hyperventilating has made me pass out a few times), but this was easily the worst one ever. Sleep deprivation lowers your threshold for tolerable panic, and my legitimate fear that I was dying (or about to have a seizure, which was the truly scary bit) just made the panic even worse. Some Xanax finally brought my pulse down, they gave me fluids, and sent me home with some low-dose Ambien. I was exhausted enough from the ER visit to sleep for 2 hours before filling the Ambien script - but once I tried the Ambien, it was worth than useless. I was so desperate I took all 10 (50mg total), spaced out a bit, within 24 hours. Did nothing. Sugar pill would have been more useful than that stuff.

After being discharged, I went to my doctor and told him that my (lowest-possible-dose) Xanax, which was prescribed mainly to treat my nighttime panic attacks and thereby help me sleep, had essentially stopped working. 

I know that my doc basically refuses to prescribe sleep aids after I asked him during our first meeting  (bc they're ""too addictive,"" tho he still gives me Xanax, Tramadol, Adderall, and now Clonazepam...). So I asked if I could switch from the Xanax to Clonazepam/Klonopin, which I took years and years ago for anxiety and knew that it worked better and longer for me than the measely .25mg Xans he had me on. And I also asked to increase my gabapentin dosage, since gabapentin often helps to relax me, too.

He actually obliged. 
Guess it pays off to earn your doctor's trust (and to find a fair doc in the first place).
So I took my 2400mg of the gaba and 4mg of the Klonopin. And, omg, it worked like a charm. For the first time in months, possibly years, I actually fell asleep, relaxed, without any problems... and slept solidly from 10pm-11am. I woke up feeling a little groggy, but otherwise well-rested. And with a clear head and much-improved mood.

I am so ecstatic about this.

This is easily the most effective treatment I've ever had, after more than a decade of trying seemingly everything. Would much prefer a natural method for sleep, of course, but nothing else has ever worked. Except heavy opiates, I guess, which are OBVIOUSLY not preferable and rapidly helped destroy my life (completely, utterly destroyed). But I stopped using opiates altogether about six months ago (yay!). These sleep problems tempted me to relapse on the opiates, but now that I know this could work, it is much easier to push those urges aside.

I'm not really recommending that anyone use benzos for sleep, because they can be very addictive/dangerous, especially long-term, and they tend to be short-acting (and one should especially take care with benzos that aren't personally prescribed, or with misuing even their own prescriptions, tho I think that goes without saying)...but this has really turned things around for me, personally. 

Maybe the Klonopin (with the gabapentin - gotta give props to the gaba, too) can help turn things around. It certainly did last night. 

And, bonus? 
I had good dreams! Not fantastic dreams, but DEFINITELY not the horrific nightmares, flashbacks, and anxiety dreams I'd gotten used to. My insomnia was definitely being exacerbated by the fear of my nightly (every. single. night.) nightmares and flashbacks regarding my trauma(s), but if that fear subsides, I suspect that restful sleep will get even easier. Last night I just had some mildly pleasant adventure dreams. The kind I used to have as a kid. And I really, really missed those kinds of dreams.

Sorry for the long post, and I know this was just one night and I shouldn't get too excited...but after thousands of terrible nights, and having tried so many other methods and essentially giving up, it's still a beacon of hope.  I'm just really impressed by how well this went and I'm SO thankful that I asked my doctor to switch (and that I remembered how effective Klonopin had been years ago). Even if the Klonopin stops working after today, I'll still be glad that I got a FULL night of restful sleep for the first time in...god, forever.

And so glad that my doctor listened to me and trusted my judgement. 
(...even if I don't really trust HIS judgement for other crazy reasons that I won't get into here...)

I hope that tonight goes just as well. As a bonus, it's helping a lot with my day-to-day anxiety, too. And as a likely combination of the restful sleep, the emotional relief, and general respite from my constant anxiety/PTSD, my mood has greatly improved. I'm drawing and writing again for the first time in about two years, because I finally have the emotional wherewithal.

I hope this doesn't come across as braggy or insensitive to those of you still struggling. I just wanted to share my relief and give some hope to others who have given up on ever sleeping properly again - that maybe something out there, even something you've tried before or have written off, could turn things around. Even if it's just for one night.

Anyway. I know this may be premature. If the Klonopin (and the gabapentin, which helps as a sedative, too) fails to work again tonight or other nights, then I'll be bummed and a little embarrassed. But as it stands...just really, really grateful. I'm desperate enough to sleep that even one night feels like a miracle.

TL;DR: After 14 years of practically untreatable insomnia, and a recent visit to the ER for sleep psychosis, I asked doc to switch from Xanax (no longer works) to Clonazepam/Klonopin/K-Pin. And got the best sleep of my life.",Clonazepam

•Etizolam
•Clonazepam
•Ativan

1089,"Eating much less sugar seems to have helped my insomnia massively. I've been an insomniac since I was in my early teens - I'm now 35. Like most people reading this, I've been through all the tortures of insomnia; the effects it's had on every part of my life have been enormous. I've also tried, over the years, all of the commonly – and less commonly – advised measures to help beat it (with the notable exception of CBTI because it's never been available to me). For a long time I've been settled in a not-so-happy middle ground of accepting frequent poor sleep, and self medicating sleeping pills (valium, lorazepam, and clonazepam are currently on my bedside - I try to avoid using these as much as possible, but it's kind of comforting to know that they're there)

&#x200B;

I've always had a sweet tooth, but never went totally crazy on sugar binges. I'd say my sugar consumption has been about average for someone from The West, or even on the lower end of the scale, considering how much sugar is in many people's diets.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been reading a few articles by people who'd cut down on, or cut out entirely, their sugar intake, and who wrote about the range of benefits they experienced (mainly fewer mood swings and more energy, but also less worry about the health risks associated with eating too much sugar). I don't think any of them mentioned better sleep, and I wasn't reading these articles with my insomnia in mind. But anyway, I started cutting down on how much sugar I eat, and I quickly saw a correlation between the days when I ate less sugar and the nights when I slept well, and the days when I slipped up and ate my normal amount of sugar, and nights when I slept badly. I do still have a pretty sugary iced coffee every morning, but apart from that I now snack on things like nuts, beans and roasted peas, and I try to resist sugary things later in the day. In fact I try not to eat anything containing added sugar after about midday.

I certainly can't say for sure that eating less sugar causing me to sleep better - it feels like it is, but it's only been a couple of weeks. But, in that time I have had a couple of nights when I went to bed thinking ""yeah, I'm not going to sleep well tonight - I  can just *feel* it"" - I'm sure all insomniacs know that feeling, and it's usually pretty accurate. Well, since cutting back on sugar, on those nights I fell asleep quickly and I slept soundly. And most nights since I've started eating less sugar, I've had the sleeping habits of a normal sleeper. My body tells me when I need to go to bed, I go up stairs and get ready for bed, read a page or two of my book and get drowsy. I put the book down, close my eyes and then shortly afterwards it's morning! All without sleeping pills.

&#x200B;

What's interesting to me is that from what I recall it's never been suggested to me to cut down on sugar in order to sleep better – not by doctors, nor by any of the numerous articles and books I've read on insomnia. I just Googled ""best ways to beat insomnia"", and none of the articles mention sugar. But now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense to me – to the point where feel pretty stupid for not thinking of it years ago! Some people could surely be less tolerant to high-sugar diets, and it could affect their sleep. Also research shows that insomnia increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. I've not read any of these studies, but the obvious question is could it be because the insomniacs studied ate more sugar, or had a lower tolerance to the sugar in their diets?

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in case it clicks with anyone else. I'm only a datapoint of one, so I really don't want to get anyone's hopes up. Believe me, I know what it's like to try something new to beat insomnia, only for it to fail. But maybe give it a go if you're an insomniac. There are other major benefits to eating less sugar, so even if it doesn't help your insomnia, you'll be making a positive change to your overall health.

&#x200B;

1090,"My prescription drug use is out of control Hey guys,

Tl;dr is that I have had insomnia since I graduated college.  My first med I took was trazodone at 50mg and that worked great...

Being up for more than 3 days without sleep is a drunken, stumbling, slurring, brain farting, -20IQ, but I probably more chance of getting a grill like this than with 9000 hours sleep how sad. Talking about girls again fucking get out of me man I know ying and yang are cool and all but, shit man, evolution make it hard - literally - to not think about women when a depressed, alone, never gf, over school age, mentally ill, internet diagnoso autismato certified by Dr Nick!  Childless, relationshipless, my therapist says this is actually a good thing for me because id be taking on others problames but (fuck if reddit has a character counter im going to be pissed I dont want to edit this crap im spewing out intuitive Kappa all over the place.

So right, no gf or kids, die alone etc a lot of western scariest thing. But you know, with meditation and Buddhism (not stricktly tied to the institutional buddhism) you can find peace within yourself. I dont want to be 50 getting boners when I go outside to get a fucking apple. Jesus christ, it slike im 14, im on high dosage ssri paroxetine kills sex drive, still get fucking boners reeeeeee. cant fucking use them feelsbadman.

would you ever become gay in a situation like this just for comfort and sexual pleasures etc? Im like 97% straight just and prostate massage froma  cock would be nice based on my own experiment but the smell is not a fucking cinderalla or jasmine its a fucking gragas or santa after running around the world delivering presents when his dog with the red nose is sick. Women smell so nice, heres a spicy story. I was living in halls up at a close uni to mine, and everyone was out on break, so I got super horny tried to enter a girls room and holy sht... the door was open. I walk around hoping to find a nice dildo but I find out something disappointing, its  a pair of panties absolutely drenched in female pheremones. Fuck, im not gay. Gay would be so easier dude i hate women cus of my mom and sister. Trans is just like, its hot porn but , i mean yeah id like to do it irl if she is hot but.... Im not fucking C9 Sneaky that dude makes me uncomfortable he makes me question fucking eternity and space and everything when he dresses like a cute girl and I want to fucking judge him since i got bullied at school and my parents would judge me but damn id probably fuck him.

there it is, Like it may feel nice but the smell of guy, sweat, semen, dude, im a guy and that shit just aint pleasant or... sexually satisfying. 

Anyway insomnia fucks people up man. I see shadows at corners of eyes past 40 hours awake. I dont give a fuck about that shadow people sht its too drama and unstimulating for me. Ive seen fucking hallucinations. I downed this liquid once at a party at uni campus to impress a girl, no idea what was in it, fucking burned my nose drank 500 ml of spirit could have died but yolo haha xd. I spent time in college observing !alphas! and they just reckless smash shit up fucking retarded johnny bravo motherfuckers, Im more of a Tyler Durden myself. Watched that film on lsd the other day, it was great until I seen how it was basically Hollywood dictating what is really from fantasy, trying to pull you in, tell you what is real isnt, pulls you in again. fuck that shit man. 

That dude has insomnia in fight club. I love that sht. Its sort of an ego identity. Im meditating frequently when I can, obviously not right now shit went down at work didnt want to get pushed around like bullies did in high school fuck sake lose a job 10 years after high school still quit a damn good job, because of the kitchen staff were fucking amazing. The stories, the lifestyle, cant fucking remember their names on Facebook and my old phone broke with their numbers.... so mad. So what, I cant remember names, dont judge me. I dont know why i cant remember names. 

A name is like, identity. Human 1, Human 2. Mother, father. Baby, Adult. McDonalds, Burger King. Trump, one sec im gonna hit some weed not hit in like 9 hours dude./ Nah im not taking a hit yet, want to wait till im queuing  up in league with my teemo jungle sheeeet weed dude hahah so cool ahaha. Actually only tried at 25, after everything else failed. and it showed me the spiritual side of life with its perception changes. It fucking saved my life. I fucks with me,.. She, fucks with me. The downs, the paranoids, the anxiety, the weed hangovers, but damn. So what if people become lazy stoners and sit around... guess what, they wont. Sitting around is fucking BORING. As a depressed medically sick note autismo gibs not having my job anymore at kfc sucks ass. I miss it, but I dont miss any sort of letting some bitches and wanks verbally rub their nutsack on my face just to keep happy a bit. I need to find their names dude and get some one on one, the stories of others, not just boring college people. all the same shit, REAL people living at 48 working at fucking kfc in the kitchen. Now thats the guy I want to talk to.

Women. If my dick never got hard for women, I'd probably like less of them. fair statement, would go both ways. I like their... emotions, fuck its hard to differentiate when your dick in your brain spazies out when you try think about a girl man im fucking neutring you dude nah im not chill my .... no, racism is... it can be funny if it isnt bullying, like joking amongst buddies. Taking the shit outta each other. Im watching some korean lol streamer called Rush, and he keeps calling americans fatty burger faces. Now thats funny, im uk and im shit teeth yellow and drink tea, but from scotland too so im a ginger FREEEEEEEEDDOOOOMMMMM  intoxicated drunk Irish singing partners grandad. 

But women,, fuckkk. Guys are funnier dude, I laugh and joke so make dudes. Some women are out of this word funny, but they aint the comedians on tv they are real life Holemies. I added the girl my sister works with right, if thats you then go ahead message me btch but Im not going long term I do not believe in it humans are fleeting energy dancing between chaos and order and chaos and order cannot fucking stay together especially my parents man.

I cant even remember them fighting but im so sure i used to cover my ears with my pillow to hear them stfu. I told my dad about my mums over abusive behaviour, he says stuff like western daddy dad, chin up, look after your mum she doesnt mean it, sticks and stones (I want to puke at that sht, id rather get my arm broken than this suffering of my soul if feels like im not alive or dead but again in the middle, suborbatory or some sht whatever that christmas thing is.

I want some homies to talk to, and hollies. Im white so i dont get black culture too much i dont listen to rap music except nicki minaj she is best rapper. Anyway, Queen were a great band but Coldplay I fucking loved dude. Their first album, sends me away from my pains and merges with the pain of everyone feeling the same frequency of pain and says ""its ok to feel this, we are here together, you are not alone, you can calm down your nervous system"" where as my body now is like fuck you this is my nervous system bitch overclock this son of a gun lets go fucking nuts.

Ofc this is the id that Frued refers to in his psychotherapy works, the id, subconscious and conscious.

My central nervous system is like... fried man. Fucking might as well be a chicken at least id be tastier. Like wtf man i have to take an ssri, a newly invented drug to not kill myself? What would I have done 100 years ago? Fucking, I'd probably have killed myself or alcoholic. My mums Dad was alcoholic, died from liver alcohol damage. My mums brother was a heroin addict, died 6 months after his mum died (my mums mum, my gran, blood relative). My poor mum. My poor uncle. Heroin man, he got into weed at 12 and then into heroin just naw fuck society. I'm on a razors edge between the same fate. Tried Codeine I hate that warm euphorice hazy sht it reminds me of Breaking Bad scene floating and sht and hell naw I prefer benzos but that sht meant to be worse than heroin withdrawal. going to get off them soon when I get back into meditation.

I tried self medicating in Novermber after I asked a Psychiatrist twice for help, twice 2 years ago, plenty of GPs. I respect benzos are dangerous, I havent withdrawn from any yet just some etizolam and vals to help that rollercoaster of xanax (never used) style ups and downs with th short half life.

Met a guy on the bus the day before I quit KFC. was going to hospital with 30 vals for her. He said ""I bet you think im just some annoying cunt hurry the fk up and stfu get out my way"". I looked him dead in the eye (I was on a bit of Etiz tbh so that helped me not freak out) and said ""I see everyone as the same"". His face paused, eyes locked on me, expressionless. I wonder if anyone had ever told this man he is loved. He looked fucked up by drugs. Ive stopped teh description cus as I said internet is  aplace of everyone and maybe drug kings reading this sht like yeah boy i got a new homie to smack up, so hell naw I want to work for Jessie Pinkman tho that crew was sound (Glasgowegian term: Sound = cool = No problemo = Love thy neighbour). Id watch that show again just the drama is fucking booorrrinnggg second time walters wife and my hatred for women man fuck me it gets toastie in my nervous system it wants to fucking flying of the face of the earth to fucking Neptune to cool down a bit. Dude im pretty sober now, this is just insomnia and my autismo mind. Im sorta high IQ, my mom says im pretty. My dad says im smart. My friend says im funny. Some girl says im so big, girls, thats a compliment we want to here man our fucking chimp brain implodes and we feel like Zues pounding the mother earth (my greek mythology sucks sorry if it sucks reference).

I'd like to hug a girl, sure whatever sex is great but not without complications, id like to share silently, explore, meditate, just fucking be without wanting something all the timee. But where are these girls, and where the fuck is my self-esteem dude gimmie dat back dats mine bro. I feel my mom took my self-esteem, crushed my soul with her black heart and death vibes with her postnatal depression, furthter depression, chronic anxiety and just taking that shit out on your kids is shit. 

I got into trouble at school a lot, wait sht, talk about women again. boobs are nice, bagina is nice, butt nice, leg, feet, hand, neck, head, hair, only bit  women i dont like i probably her poops and her brain. But thats not fair just a quick joke man, shes a man-eater look out boy here she comes. What the fuck did she do to me. I've always been shy, sensitive I think, but, just, crushed in confidence. I loved my dad so much I didnt want anything in my life to harm him. My mum..... she told me she bottle fed me cus breast feeding too sore, dont know significance but I understand. Again I forgive my mother for everything her childhood sounds shit, alcholic dad never home, emotionally abusive mom with .. having a fag lads. Dont smoke just during high stress cus i dont get addicted and confident i can quit, quit job at kfc cus bully managers, girls im a steal come get me. Actually dont im scared of you all i know the potential for girls to get into my emotional ""heart"" and wreck it ralph for funsies, well not funsies its fantasy acted out in reality unfortunately of suffering. 

Dude ive had dreams of cutting dead bodies up for art like on Dexter, necrophelia, stupid fucking freudian big fucking black trains cus i went on 4chan al last summer and always blacked pictures fuck that site its funny tho seen a random soldier steal a tank like on gta never for reported to national news dont think but was unreal. he was drunk he was just trollin bro, lighten up usa. fucking, soldiers. I wont say much. I dont know if the deep cia etc really care about da normie or da autismo internetster or just care about his/her paycheck cocaine and probably lighting up a jay. I mean how can a deep state person start a family, its suicicde dude. We all the same family. if earth blows up, we reconnect with the univerese. the tragedy of self-conscoius life ends. something else happens.

If I have a family holy shit id love my kids so much it would hurt me, i might e ven suduko cus of current mental illness in future relapse, or wife is like my mom in which case i fucking take several lines of cocaine, go strippers, shit what else you do in gta, fucking dirt bike to top of mountain and jump off and glide, steal a plane with a horse with no name and 9/11 into home street to say what up to my mates.

See I fucking, well, i didtched all my homies i grew up with. most of them got into hard drugs, my best mate is now blind, blinded by his gf smacking him with a phone into a coma. i fucking seen him in the indian shop the other day, i was in there with him. he didnt know i was there. I didnt talk to him. That cunt bullied the shit out of me when younger, maybe my mum fucked up but this guy took out my butt plug and shoved it somwhere nasty like... clintons pussie? yikes. dude politics is fucking something man, this timeline, putin, trump, brexit, shit is suck tho so much suffering.

so

so much.

If I talk shit for 28000 words then come to this realisation then its worth to me man, its a shit truth tho. life is suffering.

#on lsd, i felt for 30 mins at the peak of the trip in a place of no where. i didnt feel anything inside me, no soul etc.

~I was like ""go get some water"" and then the body was like ""why dude"" and so I just stood bent over in one position for 30 mins my legs in pain but again my brain say ""im in pain bro quick gimme some luba luba from yo moma"" but  I just accepted it and stayed silent, still, present, eckhart tolle id take his dick. buddhas too i tihnk althought probably lot of shit going on in tibet with gangs and that sht he has to support or help  i dont know.

hey cia, mk ultra only read a little bit but you wanted to use them on soldiers in war like nam? cod world at war/black ops 1 story was fucking cool man mason the numbers reminded of mk ultra like shit. good story line. Im mentally ill so I could be getting sent 5g signals to fuck me up oh shit dont say it noo immmmmm gooinnggggggggg.......







hitler? why are you in heaven? Like dude I know you had mother issues like me, you wanted to be artist and you werent good enoughs o shit dude, i seen ur paintings and they were good i thought, keep your head up. I know your dead and shit but we are all fucking one. Im no nazi, no isis, no  anarchist,  shit what am I. Awakened? Spiritually? Do girls dig that sht? Its a pretty painful experience like it aint pretty realising time is eternity and always now and everything else in mind is an illusion, perhaps consciousness itself. I mean as long as I get sex tho right. High give my bros...

chap ... chap ...

Are you Mr Blue? 

why yes and you are?

Im mr going to round house kick you into your mirror cus you knocked my daughter up.

wel sheet the condom just kill it man its no fun get abortion.

Is abortion bad though, like really. I dont think so. I kill life everyday by being alive. organisms die in my bodies defence. whatever idc.

Suicide though, like what the fuck. I mean im doing alright just now i suppose, cant complain (3000 word complaint btw)said to my therapist suicide should be allowed, its not fair on the patient.Why do people have to stay alive, there is nothing in meditation or in the state i felt in lsd that said life is a must. On that LSD dude, I tried to move but either my mind said or I realised ""I dont have to mve"" but I was like dude lets go lets take a piss man and my conscoiusness was like like ""no, you watch this, shut up, learn, just, be"".

So I did that and I grew from it. being in pain and being alright? Pain an illusion? So many less medications. I want my brain back dude. Most people I was competing with in my classes went on to get degrees and are doctors, laywers, sceintists and Im fucking, worked in mcdonalds could keep it down, kfc twice nope, deliver china man food nope, help old women with their shits and food no that was too hard but most rewarding. cex was alright just bully manager was a bint although, w.e. I want to play teemo jungle man. I want to level 2/3/4 gank all lanes with red buff and smite, spam laugh, raise emote and mastery.

I also want to say.Space. Everything. Emotions. People. Just breathe.. All we know for sure is our most ancient know and this is of breath, maybe. shit i need some meds or somethin getting bit dizzy. sht what is it.diazepam i think just 5mg should do.its only 10am//// what the fuck. I mean ill take 5mg of valium sure but kinda sucks seems like a sorta intense w.d.

Pregabalin was interesting, good and bad. good it fucking works mate if you like Phenibut then this will give you some extra resilience that according to Jordan Peterson you would have if you didnt get shat on your whole like mentally. Mums job to raise childs mental. She should of protected me ebtter. Now I play childrens video game, over 6660 hours. 900$ down. free game, how did fiddle even lose. WTF is the toxicity in this game im feeling anxious, I used like 3mg etizolam like 10 hours ago so hey its probably that, i take so valium or some etiz or that drug clonazepam i got to stop spasms in my sleep. 

Dude meditation when you get into it is better than any drug. Its just getting past the point of using drugs to get by man.      Fucking vision if fucking up man like i close my eyes open then room spins. Alcohol does that, maybe gaba drug, prob etiz couple hours to go for pregabalin, shit this sucks.

dude i better not be illt or  osme sht.

i feel like sht, but since that lsd i well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, im fucking nodding dude. i had 3 cups coffe 2 modafinil. Fucking etizolam this is what i mean it can fuck u up 2 weeks use not even every day max dose 8mg a day.

I got etiz for Insomnia! actually relevent! I kept going into work with no sleep staying up 30 hours + before start shift etc. 2 secs my face burning up dont run out of benzos kids.

Cool took  5mg diazepam, you know dude if my post gets deleted ill be pissed, but at least if a mod can read ill will feel better, say something gay like ""chin up bud"" or ""its ok man, Ill come over to your house and give u the giraffe, i know your not gay but you said butthole pleasure (gta vice city, radio right? Listen to gta radio now folks, playing the game tho is kinda, dude it pretty bad)

Im fucking pissed at games nowadays man. Microtransactions and loots, fucking dlcs, season passes, give me a full fucking game like I used to get with the customisation built in and not all about graphics ok man? GTA4 story was great and the airport was so much fun on multiplayer, I watched DansGaming and Forsen on twitch.tv play gta4 again and as an adult and like 10 years old that sht was still releveant and entertaining as fk.

really shows you with gta5. the fuck was that game dude. im driving around with sweet graphics jumping into army base to steal a jet, get out, get jumbo plain fly about, hey cool. The story tho? I like the white mafia guy aigh? He goes to see a therapist or something, probably court ordered right unlike myself *tips Benadryl* or some insomnia meme I dont want cringe shit Im from twitch chat 7 years running dude i know my shit never modded either i suck no ones dick but my own once just the tip it was aight just fleshy and warm.

Oh dude I think that etizolam w.d is going away man. that sht was like getting into a pretty bad lsd trip. fucking vision darting around, like when your really, really  REALLY drunk and your vision keeps fucking going up and down like yoyo and its funny as fuck but scary as hell. Yeh, that shit, bright lights sucked and headache. 

Only reason I got benzo as i was saying, and its Etizolam, was because of working. I have chronic insomnia lads/laddetes/oneness/future hot gamer gf who is turned on by my autism means wtf is wrong with her fucking run it sthe cia knock knock motha fucka I gonna wreck ur house and steal your lidl pc to find you bought a fucking dildo. Hmm. I wonder if sex toys in the uk especially will remain legal.

Auto women are becoming a thing, they have to be banned, absolutely. Im fucking mi5.mi6 and my population dont need the drama and mindless stress and pain that keeps them confused and wagecucking to pay for the worlds shitty karma. I wanted to join raf man as pilot. dad got me a shitty laptop from work for peanuts (very cheap uk slang) and i went to game shop, 3 pc games for 10 pound jismed man. Theme hopsital, flight simulator 98, the sims. Throw in age of empires 2 man I back in the late 90s, friends still on, charlie sheen no melt down yet, no 9/11. 

I typed some sht man but need to tidy and smarten up a bit or some paramedic gonna come. I want a hooker man. I need some pussy. I dont need just really want on biological need level. constant incessant noise in my head (grab her by pussy) oh sht im definitely banned from reddit now no pls not back to 4chan and pol/r9k its fucking exhausting getting by all the shills and tribalism. 

On that, what the fuck are we all thinking. Immigration at level never seen. Total culture shift in 1 generation. Once white dudes stop going to football and get all tribal on peoples ass theres gonna be gangs popping up. I mean there already is drugs gangs from asia and rape/child sht from middle east north africa right? I dont know what to say about that.

Dude insomnia is a killer illness literally. Look at my delerium, well most just excess mumbling autismo (no sure reddit is ok with calling anything stupid anything other than ""stupid"" which is double standard, stupid people arent stupid by choice, its discriminatory and we have a duty to look after stupid people). Some people think of masterrace of high IQ, I mean like, skt want 5 fakers, argentina want 11 messies even in goal that dude run up the post overhead kick from the bar to save penalty.

I said i took 5mg valium right?hmm. I have been up for 3 days, typing like a true autismo right now. My mom even asked if I thought I might be autstic last year, I mean I understand her concern, but that fact she caused the majority of my psychological damage, well her, Chris, Dad wasn't perfect he got scary and sectarian and I want to see him actually, need to get my benzo right can be having fucking shitty lsd trip at 10am 8-9 hours after dropping about 4 mg etizolam, kindling perhaps.

Phenibut is suchan awesome substance, Phenibut, Caffeine, (no order) Modafinil, and Pregabalin dude. I was meditating (just breath concentration focus  meditation on breath no gomba stomp awoooa throat swallowing shit and while I noticed little to no changes over the month, when I stopped, dude I fucking felt psychotic the thoughts just coming in like whot he fuk you think you are my mother? who didnt respect my personal boundaries as a child treating me as a secondary human being rather than an actual person. Fuck man. Life. Its not her fault. She had her own trauma. Now her son is using benzos to try fucking manage mama mia!

Anyway pregs was good to 450mg for a few weeks when i was meditation, my back started to like give up in strength and my body jolted away, this was super intrusive to my meditation and triggered me. I wanted to get back down to 300mg or 150mg but as soon as I started dropping the dosage my sleep went to shit and I already had insomniai so that was fucking fun jesus. Got etiz to make sure, twice a week , i can get some fucking sleep fo im not up for 80 hours working 3./4 shifts. Alas, feel kinda memory fucked after etiz and foggy, might be better just stayin up. Phenibut, coffee, modafinil, paracetamol, ibuprofen, propranolol. Great kit for you to have to do stuff when you get no sleep. Also working twice a week, Phenibut gains no tolerance used twice a week and no more vast majority of people. So you take that befoer you sleep and you wake up ready to go to work regardless of shit mood and sleep.

Gonna smoke some, play some teemo jungle idk man,60-70 hours awake. Add me on reddit         xxxx

1092,"What are the long term side effects of Rivotril (Clonazepam)? My mom has had insomnia for the last one year, and it's been a difficult time. This group has been really helpful, as the perspective of other people fighting the same thing is priceless. We've seen a sleep doctor in the region, and he had prescribed Clonazepam, which did work well. The course is over now, and my mom is supposed to take 0.25 mg of the tablet only when a bad night occurs. This tablet really does help her get sleep, however I would like to know if there are any other users out there who have been on this drug for a few years, and if you have any thoughts / known side effects on it?

We are currently in the process of trying a lot of suggestions that have worked for people on this forum, and hopefully something will work out :) ",Clonazepam
1093,"Trazodone oversleep My doctor prescribed me 25 to 50 mg of trazodone as a sleep aid (I also take effexor for depression/anxiety).

I took my first trazodone pill last night (50 mg) at about 1 am. I was unable to wake up until almost 2 pm today, and even then, I spent all afternoon groggy. It’s evening now and I still feel like I have no energy to get up.

Did anyone experience extreme sleepiness with trazodone?

I was previously taking clonazepam for anxiety, which helped me to sleep beautifully and I would wake up early and rested. But my doctor didn’t want to renew the clonazepam and opted for trazodone since it’s not addictive.",Clonazepam
1094,"Any sleeping pill similar to or better than Ambien (zolpidem)? this may be a little long, sorry. backstory: 
I'm taking 10mg of ambien, well technically more like 20-25mg because i need at least 2 to get me to sleep now. Problem is, i'm only prescribed 30 so taking 2 or more a night, you can do the math, i'm out long before i can get another refill. i've been on it for a little over 2 years now. my tolerance is getting too high. 

so i'm curious to know what works for you guys or if you have any advice on how i can lower my tolerance or something. i like the ambien, not only the euphoric feeling before bed (which is nice because i'm severely depressed during the day), but when it works, it works. i go to sleep, stay asleep, & wake up functioning properly. 

i highly doubt my doctor will increase me to 60 pills, he's already said there's no dose higher than 10mg (is that even true?), but i'm afraid to tell him about this because if he takes me off of it & puts me on something else & it doesn't work i'm back at square one. i've tried manyyyy things before getting to ambien btw. 

TLDR: if you're on a sleeping pill that's working for you, what is it? what does it feel like? and is there anything similar or better than ambien?

edit: a bit more about me if this helps. if i don't have my ambien, i will pretty much not sleep until my body physically tires itself out & i pass out from exhaustion aka ~ 2 days. i'm also taking 1mg clonazepam for anxiety, but had some issues with my doctors so my ambien script & my klonopin script come really far apart, i'll always have only one & not the other when i'm actually supposed to be taking them together as my full treatment. any advice or tips regarding sleeping pills would be much appreciated. i'm desperate, frustrated, and extremely depressed. i need sleep..

1096,"Help, constant state of exhaustion Hi all,

Hoping that some of my fellow Redditor’s can provide me with some guidance.

For years now, I have been struggling with getting meaningful sleep on a consistent basis. I’ve tried to address it in passing with a doctor here and a doctor there, but I’ve never been to a Doctor explicitly for sleep issues.

The Doctors I did discuss it with in the past, wrote me a short prescription for Ambien, Lunesta another time, Tramadol once. The Ambien would be ok, but not super effective, it’s been years, but I think the Lunesta was about the same, maybe a bit less effective, and the Tramadol did nothing.

In the past I have had some Anxiety issues, additionally I am a Tinnitus sufferer. I’ve adapted to the Tinnitus over the years, but unfortunately, I was a smaller percentage of the group for whom the onset of Tinnitus is devastating and destabilizing, akin to mental torture.Its still a bad thing, but it doesn’t have the control over my life it once had.

Since I’m a bit of an anxious type, after I got my prescription for Ambien, I researched it, read a bunch of awful things about it, horror stories and what not, and promptly stopped taking it. However, since it did help a little, I kept it and did use stretch it’s use by making it last about a year, took one very, very infrequently.

In the immediate aftermath of my Tinnitus, I was prescribed a prescription of Clonazapem to help me cope, for moments where maybe things felt out of control. I did use it a few times,  it similar to the Ambien, I researched it, read some awful things, became fearful, and stopped taking it. The bottle sat in my cabinet for a few years. About a year and a half ago, I couldn’t sleep one night, remembered the Clonazepam, and decided to take one to see if it wold help. Man did it ever! I doubled up ok the 1MG dosage, so I took 2 MG, and had one of the best nights of sleep ever. I used the remaking pills sporadically over the course of the ensuing month until they were gone.

I am at a point now where I need to do something. I can’t keep living like this where I operate in this mental fog/haze, and constant state of exhaustion. I average maybe 3-4 hours of sleep each night. I am a bit of a night owl, so it’s hard for me to go to sleep early, but I have tried all the sleep hygiene recommendations, dark room,  no tv phone, read book, warm bath, glass of milk, on and on and on,  one of it has done anything. My chief issue is getting to sleep, I will lay down, and simply cannot fall asleep, mind thinking of random things, work, family, news, sports, wondering if I’ll sleep, whatever it is, point is, my mind is going. I try to focus on nice mental pictures, or just a stop thinking in general, but nothing works. Eventually I might nod off, but then usually i will up a few hours later. And if I do get to sleep, once I wake up, game over, I can never get back to sleep.

Tried melatonin, otc sleep aids, they all seem to have random effectiveness, and nothing ever works well. I’ve noticed a sort of pattern, where I will go a few days in a row with little to. I sleep, and then one day where I get some decent sleep because my body can’t hold up from the lack of sleep, sort of like a yo-yo. The difference I do feel on the rare nights I get decent sleep is amazing, but also, I am a light sleep let so nosies else me up, and sometimes I wake up startled with me heart pounding, because it like scares me awake.

I still remember how effective the Clonazepem was, and would really like to try it again, but I mentioned it once to the doctor I have about 6-8 months ago, and he became all fired up. and s complete jerk to me...said he wouldn’t even consider prescribing me that, because it is addictive, and I would become addicted. I didn’t argue the point, because I’m more of an introvert in that way, but it was upsetting, because he doesn’t understand how terrible this is impacting my day to day life.

I have a complicated technical job, which I struggle with in some ways because I am exhausted all the time due to lack of sleep, and I am a parent to 5 kids who need a functioning dad.

I’m at the end of my rope, with the feeling of sand paper in my eyes as I type this. I’m hoping that some of you can offer me some help on ideas for next steps. Like try to find a different doctor for the Clonazepam, or is there no point because they will all be resistant and battle me like my main doctor did when I tried bring omg it up.

I’m in the greater Atlanta area if anyone has any area specific recommendations.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.",Clonazepam
1097,"Anyone else only able to sleep for an hour at a time? 26 y.o. female, 5'4"", 135 lbs, white. I take Viibryd 40 mg/daily and buspirone 10 mg/2 times daily.

For the past three months, I have had horribly fragmented sleep. I usually have no issues falling asleep within 20 or 30 minutes, but every time I do, I wake up almost exactly an hour later. It's like clockwork. Here's an example of what a typical night is like for me:

9:30 PM get in bed ~10 PM fall asleep ~11 PM wake up ~11:30 PM fall asleep ~12:30 PM wake up ~1 AM fall asleep ~2 AM wake up and so on... til about 6 or 7 in the morning, when I find myself too awake to fall asleep, but still so drained and exhausted.

I have dealt with depression and anxiety for years, and I know they can cause sleep issues. I had been managing them pretty well up until I took a trip 3 months ago (right before all this started) and had a panic/vomiting episode on the airplane (it was my first time travelling alone and I hate to fly.) I have been working on my anxiety and depression issues with a CBT therapist for the past 2 months, and I feel like I've been making progress. I also made the discovery about a week ago that I was undereating for the past three months (I went on a diet before my trip,) only consuming about 1,300 calories a day, when the proper amount for a woman of my age, size, and activity level should be more like 1,900. Eating the proper amount has greatly lessened my anxiety and somewhat helped my sleep issues, but I am still waking up almost EXACTLY every hour.

It should be noted, I AM experiencing REM sleep, as I have vivid dreams during each hour I get of sleep. I think I often wake up during REM, because it takes me a good minute or so when I wake up to realize I'm in bed and not still dreaming.

I have a couple theories of what could be causing this...

Sleep apnea. I realize I am not the typical older, overweight male that gets this, but it still seems possible. For what it's worth, my father has severe sleep apnea and uses a CPAP. Could it be that I am experiencing an obstructed airway during the total muscle relaxation of REM sleep, and this is why I wake up with such perfect ""timing"" every hour?

Acid reflux. This also runs in the family, on my mom's side. I saw a doctor for severe heartburn during college a few years ago when I was under heavy stress, but it seemed to subside after a few weeks... But lately, I have been noticing ""wet burps"" and a feeling of food coming up, a weird pressure feeling that comes and goes, almost like I need to burp but nothing is coming out. I don't really experience any pain, like heartburn, just feeling food come up during the day, but it doesn't hurt. Again, maybe getting to the point of muscle relaxation in REM, perhaps food is coming up my esophagus during the night and awakening me? I will say that I never experience the coughing or choking that many nighttime GERD sufferers seem to report. I never feel like something is in my throat upon awakening. I just... wake up.

Sinus congestion (allergies). My nose gets really stuffy when I am in my apartment. I keep it clean, but there is clearly something here that is giving me congestion, as I don't typically experience it elsewhere. I often find that by sunrise, my nasal passages are so constricted that I have to breathe through my mouth. It makes sense that this would cause sleep issues, but... it wouldn't make sense for me to wake up after the same amount of time, EVERY TIME. Also, even when I sleep somewhere else for a night and don't have the sinus issues, I am still awakening every hour.

I'm at a loss. My daytime alertness, memory, concentration, and mental health are all suffering because of my very fragmented sleep. My shrink has tried me on 4 different meds for sleeping (trazodone, clonazepam, seroquel, and clonidine) all of which help me get to sleep a little faster, but I still wake up every hour (I was only ever taking them one at a time, and now I have stopped taking any of them.) I feel like the mental health issues may be a contributing factor, but I can't help but think there is more going on here... I've had my thyroid tested, normal. Vitamins, normal, except for a borderline-low level of vitamin D, which I have been taking supplements for for the last 2 weeks to start to correct it.

I have an appointment to meet with a sleep specialist next week... but the sooner I can get answers, the better. I am suffering mentally and physically. Anyone have any ideas or input? Thank you so much.",Clonazepam
1098,"Belsomra has been life changing for me. I have bipolar disorder that falls more on the depressed end of the spectrum, and have dealt with insomnia on and off almost my entire life. It used to hang around for a week or so at a time but lately over the past several months it has been absolutely awful. The pattern usually being about three nights of no sleep and then I’d sleep the 4th night bc Id be so exhausted from not sleeping the past three. 

I tried almost everything, including Ambian which made me feel sick and hungover. Might as well not sleep if you’re going to feel like a zombie anyway. 

Bought black out curtains, have every sleep app and podcast, an essential oil diffuser by my bed, tried taking hot baths every night before bed, and have night shift set on my phone... all to no avail. I did have some success with the getting out of bed and reading in low light, but not reliable. The only thing I did have consistent success with was clonazepam, which I’m sure most of you have also been told isn’t a long-term solution. 

Doctor recently prescribed me Belsomra, which I was super resistant to trying based on all of the terrible things I read about it online and in this sub, but I was desperate so I gave it a try. 

It’s been about three weeks since I first started taking it, and I’m sorry I hadn’t tried it sooner. There is no hangover or grogginess whatsoever. I go to bed around 10 every night (take the belsomra around 9:30) and my eyes pop open at 6am every morning. It’s also been my experience that I don’t need to take it every night. Could be psychosomatic or maybe something to do with Belsomra’s really long half life (idk I’m not a doctor or scientist.) 

Anyway, if you have decent health insurance, hate ambian and feel like you have exhausted all of your other options, I highly recommend giving it a try. 

I will note that I don’t think it’s magic in that in order to reap the most benefit you still have to maintain good sleep hygiene, like turning off screens an hour before bed, having a very dark room, and abstaining from caffeine or too much sugar in the afternoon.  

I do also smoke a bit of indica with the belsomra in order to ease the anxiety over sleep that I’ve developed. If you have the means in your state, maybe give that a try first before you reach for another scrip. I just found that weed isn’t enough for me on its own. ",Clonazepam
1099,"Desperate Insomniac I've been having on-off sleep problems throughout the years, but it has become progressively worse since June-ish this year.

I have tried melatonin (which does fuck all for me), as well as clonazepam (which my mum insisted I take) and trazodone (actual prescription). None of them seem to work too well; I took a half dose of trazodone an hour and a half go, to no avail. Just took another half dose.

This ***ALWAYS*** happens the night before a weekday (I'm a student and have many 8am classes) or any event , and despite all my efforts I cant seem to clear my mind for more than a couple of minutes.

Here's the kicker: during literally any other time except bed time, I can pop into my bed and will be out in 5 minutes, and tbh it's the only thing I can do most of the time.

This is making me feel frustrated, angry, depressed and lately even suicidal thoughts have started to emerge, as this has seriously started to affect my academic and personal life. You can't exactly student properly when 99% of the time you are fighting the urge to sleep, or properly socialise when insomnia just drags your entire mood to hell.

1100,"Anyone try Nozinan/Methotrimeprazine? 33 year old male here with 33 year history of intractable insomnia (so since birth). 

For the past 10 years I've been on nightly trazodone 250mg, clonazepam 2mg, benadryl 50 (more makes me hallucinate). 

This combo gets me about 2-3 hours sleep on a good night if I also take quetiapine 50 few times a week. I can't take quetiapine often because it stops working. Really nothing actually works. I also have to drink some alcohol every few nights for all these drugs to kick in, and I cycle everything. 
My sleep hygiene is impeccable, you don't live like this for 33 years without good sleep hygiene.  

Hypnotics don't make me sleepy, they just make me incredibly hyper and erase my memory. I actually never feel drowsy or fatigued and even on all my sleep meds I often just lay there with my eyes open. 

Doc recently tried one last thing with this Nozinan, usually used for people dying of cancer in palliative care. It actually gave me 7 hours two nights in a row when added to my combo. Only lasts 3 nights in a row before I'm back to 3-4 hours, but those two nights were AMAZZZING! 

My issue is it's such a dirty drug (hits pretty much every receptor hard) and I've been getting heart flutters. Has anyone tried it and had any success?

1101,"The past few nights I've been to the point where I'll be half asleep and sort of dreaming, and then suddenly jerk awake for no reason. What is this? What I've been experiencing this week has not been the same as when you're asleep and feel like you're falling and then suddenly wake up, nor does it feel like restless leg syndrome but it feels a little closer to RLS. I'll be half asleep where I'm sort of dreaming and sort of conscious, and right as I'm about to actually fall asleep all of a sudden my body will feel like it needs to be awake NOW and my body will jerk awake. It's like a tense, squirmy feeling in every muscle in my body. It's extremely uncomfortable and it happened at least ten or fifteen times last night. I was so exhausted I wanted to cry. 

Getting up and walking around doesn't really help and stretching on its own didn't do much. I had my SO put all of his weight on my legs to stretch them to the point where it ached, and the pain sort of distracted from the squirminess which finally allowed me to sleep.

1102,"Unable to get more than 4 hours of sleep for the past four days Hello,

I am 19 years old and last week one night i slept wrong and ended up with torticollis which lead to me to use ibuprofen for a week twice a day. 4 days back i was only able to sleep 4 hours and was awoken by a sharp jolt of pain due to torticollis in the neck. Next day i tried to wean myself of ibuprofen by taking half dose and taking clonazepam. That in hindsight was a big mistake. I was only able to sleep 3 hours at night that day and the clonazepam had no effect instead it amplified my anxiety and depression(I have a exam coming on Sunday for which i have to travel by flight). Yesterday after feeling whole day that my heart is racing and a general loss of appetite,heaviness in chest and anxiety about not being able to sleep i was able to sleep for 4 hours but was woken by an empty stomach and was unable to go back to sleep.Today also even after trying multiple times i am unable to go to sleep, I feel my head getting heavier and heavier and my eyes start twitching(i read this was because of misfiring neurons?) until i reach state where i am alert with my head heavy.

In hindsight i think taking the clonazepam was a mistake as it seems to have messed with hormonal balance. I am not sure what exactly is causing my anxiety whether it is the exam coming up or the stress because of not being able to sleep properly. So i am looking for some advice here should i be worried that clonazepam may have messed up with my hormonal balance or should i just try to sleep disregarding that. Another thing that could have caused that anxiety was the jolt i received due to toricollis which may have subconsciously affected my mind to prevent me from sleeping.

1105,"What to do next? Insomnia getting worse over last decade Strange use for a throwaway, but my regular name is known at work, and I want to keep this separate.

Backstory: Former military and law enforcement. PTSD never diagnosed - I've experienced some of the symptoms but always ""diminished"" them in conversations with doctor due to professional reasons.

I've been having trouble getting to sleep for over 10 years now. Once I'm asleep, I usually sleep well, though. My mind simply ""races"" on events, plans, and memories (some trivial, some significant).

Over the years, I've done tons of improvement to sleep hygiene (light color temperature, nuisance lights, noise, room temperature, etc).

I've had two sleep studies done - but for no apparent reason. The doctor simply observed that I could never get to sleep in the first place.

I've gotten conversation therapy for relaxation techniques. I've tried (over 10 years, bear in mind), prescriptions for Ambien, Xanax, Trazodone, Lorazempam (Ativan),  and Clonazepam (Klonopin). I've also tried Paxil and Cymbalta (seperately) for about 90 days each.

The vast majority of those drugs don't touch the problem at all. Ambien does, but only at 20 or sometimes even 30 mg doses. Even it at it's a 50-50 shot. This has been since I first tried ambien years ago, and I've always been conscious to rotate on and off of the ambien, sometimes staying off for weeks, to minimize dependence.

Notable things I haven't tried include alternative treatments - things like hypnosis and acupuncture. Notably I also never tried pot (never in my life, actually). It'd be the death of my career, basically, and as desperate as I am for sleep, I'm not ready to make that trade.

At this point I'm looking for ideas. I recently moved, and my primary care provider is fairly unsympathetic.. she'll prescribe ambien, but it doesn't really work.

I'm eligible for care from the VA, and I have an appointment with a PCP there next week.

I have no problem seeking therapy and similar lifestyle treatments, but I also think I need a pharmacological option in the short and mid term to function through this. My health and other life issues outside of sleep are pretty squared away.

If you've read this far, thank you. If you've got any suggestions - medication to try, a specific referral to ask for, whatever, I'd love to hear it.",Clonazepam
1106,"Sleep therapy: The battle begins Having exhausted all other avenues of help, I went back to the psychiatrist today. I slept about 3 hours yesterday with 1mg Clonazepam and 100mg Tradozone. Was up at 330 am full of energy from god knows where. I use a small letter 'g' because I don't believe in a god anymore.

I am now officially on 150mg Trazodone and 1mg Clonazepam per night - an increase from my previous prescription of 50mg Trazodone and 0.5mg Clonazepam. Apparently this combination is ‘better in the long term’ than 7.5mg Zopiclone (which I LOVED because it worked). 

No more melatonin because apparently it can have a paradoxical effect in some people. Sleep hygiene as usual - I never drink caffeine, avoid sugar and chocolate, dark room, earplugs, cool temperature. I will be continuing with sleep restriction - in bed 11pm, out of bed at 630 am whether I have slept or not. The usual stuff about getting out of bed and reading for awhile if you haven’t slept for 30 minutes. Exercise daily, though apparently the minimum requirement is 20 min of cardiovascular exercise at least twice a week. And I follow the same bedtime routine every day.

But here are some new things I learned today, which you might find helpful: 

- ZERO screens an hour before bed. I knew this, but counteracted it using f.lux. Yet I have just been told that even f.lux is not reliable, so yes, you just have to switch them all off. 

- ZERO food in the middle of the night no matter how hungry I am. I always knew that restricting food before bedtime was advisable, but I would often get too hungry and upset after hours of sleeplessness at 2.30 am. Now, I can have a light snack at 930pm before bed (11pm) and that's it. I thought my low blood sugar was keeping me awake, but all snacks past 930 are not kosher now.

- ZERO checking the time, even after you have slept. I always refrained from checking the time while sleepless, but I thought it was OK to check the time if I woke up after having slept a few hours (eg at 3am). Apparently this is also bad and I will stop doing it. 

- Put all electronic devices OUTSIDE of the bedroom. Honestly, I thought it was OK just switching them completely off and leaving them there (I never have the temptation to check them). But they will have to leave the room physically now. 

- Instead of 5-7-5 breathing I have been told to practice 7-5-7 breathing. I am obviously skeptical about this but will give it a try, since one of my major issues is palpitations. 

- Medication 30 min before bed, not one hour like we are sometimes told. 

- ZERO alcohol - even in the daytime, not even one beer. 

- Write down several of my problems before bed in a notebook, and think of solutions for them, and snap the book shut. Apparently this book-shutting noise is supposed to Pavlov me into forgetting my troubles. Again, am skeptical, but will obey. 

Tonight is my first night on this new and improved regimen, and seeing as I've been up since 330 am, as I have said, I do hope it will work.

1107,"Update: Everything falls apart, the centre cannot hold, my life is worse than incy wincy spider's Remember when you were a child and heard the song, 'Incy Wincy Spider'?

**Incy Wincy Spider, climbed up the water spout.**

I try to sleep, good sleep hygiene, I take 1mg Clonazepam, 50 mg Tradozone, and 3mg Melatonin. Exercise, good diet. 

**Down came the rain, and washed the spider out.**

But I still can't sleep. The Clonazepam is about as useful as a wet rag at this point, after only about 2 weeks. I had to take 2.5 mg of it, plus everything else, and it was still one zopiclone that forced me to sleep at 3am. Up again 6am naturally, exhausted but can't sleep. 

**Out came the sun and dried up all the rain**

Well, this part of my story has not occurred yet. Still looking for an effective sleep remedy (the sun), because the actual sun is really not helping me sleep. Yes, I expose myself to the sun every morning. 

**And incy wincy spider went up the spout again**

I'm still not giving up in the meantime - CBT and psychiatrist will see me on Friday - but hell, what's the point of this? I am asleep when awake - feels horrible to be on so little sleep with so much medication - and awake when asleep. But I can't even take a NAP if I want to, not because of sleep hygiene, but because I simply cannot sleep. ",Clonazepam
1108,"Update: Psychiatrist I posted here awhile ago talking about how my GP had given me zopiclone, and how it [helped me](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/5prcjk/zopiclone_give_it_a_try/?st=iz09wlbj&sh=790c163c). I wasn't getting tolerant to it, but I was definitely building a psychological dependence on it. 

Anyway, as you know, I've tried everything - don't even *talk* to me about sleep hygiene, I could write a book about it. I control the temperature (must be cool), use a heavier blanket (weighted blankets have helped for some). I take melatonin, magnesium, I make sure I'm eating carbs, fats, proteins. No coffee, no caffeine, and I avoid refined sugar as much as possible (i.e. no candy bars, no sweet white bread). Everything seems to spike my energy levels randomly, so I have to avoid anything remotely stimulating. I quit smoking months ago, avoid alcohol, etc. GABA, Valerian root, Remeron (mirtazapine) - all tried and tested. Flux too, avoid screens totally 2 hours before bed. 

I also went to bed at the same time every day (11pm) and woke up at the same time every day (6.30). I have never been someone who enjoys sleeping in - I usually woke up at 5am of my own accord, even if I had fallen asleep at 3am. Yes, I had my thyroid tested but there were no issues. Lots of exercise - at least 1h briskwalking a day, usually adding weights and intensive (running and rowing) cardio. I had also been taking a beta blocker for my palpitations at night.

I was sick of not sleeping at all (would lie in bed and think, *here comes the sun*) even after taking these measures. So I was referred to see a sleep specialist, who is also a psychiatrist.

Turns out I have two problems. 

- Firstly, my insomnia is hereditary. I know there's this big argument about whether you can inherit insomnia or not. But apparently, I have. My mother has similar sleep issues - I remember her wandering around the house at night when I was a child, just unable to sleep. My aunts (her sisters) are the same way. My grandfather's (her father) insomnia is legendary in our family. Unfortunately I have no data on what my grandfather's parents were like, but anyway, all these generations of misery have accumulated in me. I will not be having children - and this is one of the main reasons. I could never inflict this kind of torture on anyone, I would not wish insomnia on my worst enemy. 

- Secondly, apparently I have an anxiety disorder. 

So, my new med combination:

- Trazodone 50mg

- Clonazepam 0.5 mg

- More melatonin 

I am to stop the zopiclone immediately, and take these instead one hour before lights out. This makes me a bit nervous, but I hope I will be able to sleep. I will be sticking to the same sleep hygiene procedures I have outlined above. I have had CBT before, but I will also be starting that again. I really want to get rid of this insomnia, but in a way I know it's permanent. 

Anyway, if you have had any experience with these meds, or any more suggestions for me, I welcome them.",Clonazepam
1109,"Nothing is working.... Still having early morning awakening Over the last 10 months, no matter what time I go to sleep, I will still wake up between 4-5am and can't fall back asleep. I set the alarm for 6:30 for work. On work nights I usually go to bed about 10-10:30pm and usually asleep by 10:30-11pm. I don't usually have much trouble falling asleep, but always  wake up early, usually (but not always) to urinate, and then I can't sleep again. Over  the past few nights, I've tried to decrease  consumption of any liquids within 2 hours of sleeping and I still wake up despite not needing to use the restroom. I try to meditate, focus on breathing, listen to a boring audio book, but nothing works. I've tried Benadryl, Zyrtec, Temazapam (Ristoril), Propranenol, Clonazepam  (Klonopin), melatonin, and I smoke weed every night (indica or hybrid), but 90% of the time still wake up early. Some of these meds work the first night I take them if I haven't taken that same one in  over 2 weeks, but doesn't work as well the  2nd night and usually not at all the 3rd night. Sometimes my partner's light snoring wakes or keeps me up, so I often wear ear  plugs and in  the past week leave the AC fan on as background white  noise. My sleep has been the worst the past week. Most  of the sleep recommendations remedies in most books, blogs, sites say the same things: avoid more than 1 or 2 caffeine drinks per day, don't drink caffeine after 2pm, don't look at your phone or a screen prior to sleep, meditate, keep the room a bit cool, etc. I've done all these things. Over the past 1/2 year, I've had  a dark curtain over the bedroom window which makes the room pitch black even in the day time. But, nothing is working. 

It's common knowledge early morning insomnia is often due to depression. While I've suffered through this in the past during periods of being depressed, I'm actually not depressed at all these days. I don't like my job, but it's paying better than most options I have out there. So overall, though life  isn't perfect, I'm in a better place than I have been for years, so I don't think or feel I'm depressed. My anxiety is lower too. I  was even exercising regularly, but have stopped in the past month due to completely  lack of energy. Even if I was depressed, anti-depressants don't work with me and I've tried many kinds. They all work for the first few months, but then take an evil turn and make me more depressed and even suicidal so I don't touch them anymore.

I don't need advice on going to a sleep specialist or sleep clinic as I can't afford that. I live in America and have sh*t health insurance, can't afford to buy a better one and make more than I can to qualify for ACA. I need some real advice from people who have  gone through this first-hand and not some doctor or academic who has no idea how physicaally and emotionally exhausting it is to try functioning day in, day out on only 4-5 hours sleep per night.

1110,"First full week of insomnia and finally relief I have had periods of insomnia in the past. I would have trouble falling asleep until usually 6-7 am. This hadn't happened since August 2015 when I started vinyasa yoga. 

This time, I would fall asleep at my usual time, sleep for an hour or two then wake up abruptly and then find it impossible to sleep again until 6-7 am out of sheer exhaustion.

So this last week was the week of hell. A lot of things coincided to make it terrible:

* My dad made it known he was gravely concerned about my future as I had been unemployed (by choice) since July 2015. This comment made me feel extreme pressure as it is out of my hands / having a masters degree and no job essentially = failure.

* My mom left on vacation, food dwindled from nutritious to maintenance mode. Insomnia immediately zapped my energy, otherwise I would've been all over this. I love cooking and eating well.

* Had 2 job interviews

* Started new job on thursday

* Had to quit current yoga studio due to new job schedule and location


I slept 2 hrs every night except on Tuesday when I slept a full 8. 
Knowing I have something important and/or new to do the next day almost guarantees I will not sleep. 

So I started this job on thursday and right off the bat apologized for looking like a crack addict and not being more enthusiastic. I still managed to give some good input during meetings and my boss and I connected over the 'mind racing and not being able to sleep' thing.

On Friday evening I tried to find a doctor but couldn't. Ordered overpriced super stuffed delicious tacos because I got money now, figured fatigue from overeating could only help. Mom came back and gave me liquid Clonazepam. I poured 1 drop too many and got scared, this drug being unfamiliar to me. Dipped a q-tip in it to remove, might have been left with a very low dose. Slept from 9:30 pm -1 am and from 4 am to 1 pm.

Saturday: wake up feeling much better but knowing I still have a strong sleep deficit. Find doctor, explain. I wanted something other than Clonazepam but she said while my anxiety was not distressing or debilitating, panic attack style, it was still anxiety which prevented my sleep. I accepted it and also bought Melatonin 5mg sublingual.

* 10:15 pm: took 0.5 mg Clonazepam tablet
* 11:15 pm: feel nothing physical, but my brain is not throwing out unsolicited thoughts at me. no helpful drowsiness.
* 11:30 pm: took sublingual melatonin. no bad taste, quick dissolve.
* 12:00 am: SLEEEEEEEEEPPPPP!!!!!!!!!
* 7:00 AM: wake up, try to go back to sleep
* 8:30 am: get out of bed as going back to sleep was unsuccesful. So I had breakfast, did laundry, walked around 3 miles, got a good dose of sunshine. hoping to jumpstart a better schedule this monday that relies only on melatonin. I really don't want the clonazepam unless I absolutely need it. 

I also bought a new pillow that is a lot softer. My other pillows were made of some sort of latex memory foam that were soft but firm and held shape well. However, they didn't make me feel like I could *melt* into them. This one does. 

I also bought lavender essential oil. I made a lavender spray by mixing with alcohol and water. I spritz this on my sheets and in the air. Smells good but doesn't last. Also used the oil directly on my pillow, a few drops on each side. In a totally coincidental move, I found a hair scrunchie and put 4 drops on it. I wore it in my hair and then put it on my wrist when I went to bed. I could hold it to my nose and inhale deeply as needed, I found this to be *extremely* soothing. ",Clonazepam

1112,"Klonopin I got a scrip for Klonopin (clonazepam) for insomnia five years ago. I took it occasionally, then gradually more and more. In late 2013 and early 2014 I was taking it pretty often. The good part is that it gave my brain some much needed rest and I began to be more sharp. I was concerned though about how much I was taking it. I didn't take it while on some overseas trips and due to jet lag I slept without pills for awhile. Then early this year the Klonopin stopped working. It seemed like melatonin and Benadryl, which I also sometimes use, stopped working also. I decided to be pill-free and for three months I was sleeping 5-6 hours a night but I wasn't tired. Then I crashed. I was totally exhausted for about 3 weeks. I went to a psychiatrist who told me it can take 3 months or longer (!) to withdraw from Klonopin. NO ONE TOLD ME THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT THE SCRIP. The psychiatrist prescribed a low dose of Lamictal, but i haven't taken it because I am sleeping ok now with just 3 mg melatonin or 25 mg Benadryl. However until a week ago I was taking 9 mg melatonin to sleep. I think the Klonopin withdrawal is now finally over. ",Clonazepam
1113,"My Worst experience yet. Hello everyone, I'm sitting at my computer right now, on my roughly 127th hour with no sleep longer that maybe minutes at a time, and no more that 90 minutes all together.
before I start ill let you all know that I'm an 18 y/0 male, and have had chronic insomnia of some weird variety along with equally mysterious anxiety and depression for a while. I have found after MANY MANY pharmaceuticals that the only thing that can consistently and safely help me is cannabis (I have medical), i have a very special relationship with the plant, for one it has literally saved my life, helped me to save anothers life, and is quite honestly keeping me sane and perhaps non-suicidal at this very moment. But two, I seem to have the highest and most peculiar natural tolerance I have ever seen or read about bar one man. But those are stories for another day. I also have Ritalin and Clonazepam that I use hesitantly as needed. But I've been out for about a month now on each. So, with that said, Let's begin.

I wake up friday morning around 9:00am and putter around then head to work, my girlfriend comes over that night because we are leaving at 5:30 am to head to lake Champlain for a vacation. Despite a nice bong pack (which would usually do the trick) with the addition of 3/4 a dose of nyquil and some melatonin for good measure. I fell asleep, maybe 10 minutes because our alarm went off, maybe not at all. And yes, I was awake the whole night, i dont drift in and out without knowing it. 
The drive home the next day was when i first started to feel some effects. just general shittyness, who wouldnt?

Anyways next night I got 0 hours whatsoever sleeping by myself. The next I got maybe 20 minutes at one specific time while sleeping with my gf. (she sleeps fine)

The next night i was finally home, and thinking that i was soooo tired and i had already gone 2 days without smoking it would be a perfect time to take a bit of break. Well by 2 am that plan wasnt working so i tried smoking, and again later at around 6 am. was up well until it was light out, long after the birds started, when i drifted, only to be abruptly awakened by a call from work. I missed a shift that was supposed to start 48 minutes ago. they were understanding but i was completely awake now. It was useless to try and go back to bed 

Last night I had finally obtained clonazepam .5mg after finally getting in touch with my psyc doc. During the early part of the day i took 3 and smoked a bit thinking this was it finally... Nothing.
Later that night I smoked a hefty metric shiton and took 8 pills. I'm incredibly in tune to my body and know what doses of familiar substances are safe. (Side notes, smoking has always been more effect than any reasonable [<3mg] dose of kpins).
this somehow didnt work...
This is when i started to get scared... Have you ever heard of Peter Welch? He was aman who essentially worked himself into a 3 month deeply rooted psychosis due to sleep derivation and drug abuse. http://www.stilldrinking.org/the-episode-part-1 read them all and you will thank me. Nothing has been a more interesting and insightful read in my entire life. I digress

So all today, hallucinations, delirious thoughts, headaches, nausea, and a plague of other symptoms have ailed me. But as long as i smoke, I am able to somehow, beyond all reason, feel almost completely normal and fine, that is until I come down... 

But here is my solution, I've come to the end of my journey, My GP finally replied and prescribed ambien (against my wishes and recommendation of other drugs, but whatever, it sure as hell will work). So my plan is this, ina bout a 45 minutes I will take a rather heroic sized dab of reclaim (I love nothing more than dab reclaim, it is in my experience the most sedating, hypnotic, anti-anxiety, and tranquilizing cannabis product available.  This is due to its massive CBN content in case anyones wondering.
but after that I will wat about 20 to 30 minutes to get the full come on of the sedative effects (after the initial rush fades), then pop one 10mg ambien as instructed, THEN have a big pizza. Have the ambien on an empty stomach!

So i guess all I have to say is, Wish me luck! I'd be happy to answer any questions. ",Clonazepam

1115,"Request: Alternatives to the usual sleep meds A benzo for insomnia is not gonna work for me because I take clonazepam 3 mg in the morning. I've suggested triazolam in the past but she shot that down.

Here's what has helped some: Seroquel 150-200 mg. A low dose opiate, obviously not gonna get that rx-ed for insomnia. Don't want to up the dosage of the Seroquel as it has caused akathisia in me at higher doses. God I wouldn't wish that feeling on anyone. Nigh time is TORTURE lately. Psych appt. is this week Thu.

1116,"Ambien vs Ambien CR I have had really bad insomnia for several years now. I've tried lots of different medications, diet changes, routine changes, exercise, valerian, melatonin, benadryl, etc. It's very difficult for me to fall asleep and once I do, it's a restless sleep and I wake up exhausted. Also, I think the maximum amount of time I've sleep is 3-4 hours at a time. And that's rare. Usually, I wake up within 45 minutes to an hour after falling asleep, which explains the waking up exhausted. I was taking Ambien for awhile but it seems to have become less effective (maybe I'm building a tolerance?) I'm on Lunesta now but it's not much help at all. If the Ambien became less effective in keeping me asleep, would Ambien CR be a better option? If I have a tolerance to Ambien, would the Ambien CR have no effect on me? Or could it be that extra layer that claims to keep you asleep like a normal human might solve the problems with Ambien slowly becoming less effective?

I don't know if that made any sense. I'm just worried because if lunesta sucks with me and ambien doesn't work like it used to, then if Ambien CR isn't an option, I'm kind of screwed. Meds like trazodone and temazepam aren't sleep medications but I've had prescribed in the past in an effort to get me some sleep...those didn't work. Clonazepam doesn't do much, either. Any suggestions are welcome. Lunesta and Ambien are the only sleeping pills I know about that aren't like rohypnol or something crazy like that so I'm scared I'm running out of options.",Clonazepam

I can think of maybe 3 times in the past few years I've actually slept through the night sans alcoholic coma. Clonazepam had worked kinda, but I had to stop due to the habit forming tendencies. Melatonin, anti-depressants etc all failed.

1118,"My short term “cure” for insomnia (long post) I had a trauma occur and have had insomnia for almost year. I know that insomnia has to be up there with the worst mental conditions. 

I had a bout of insomnia with no REM and no deep sleep for a month, I felt awake the whole time and it was the worst experience of my life. I felt like my natural ability to sleep was broken and circadian rhythm was damaged beyond repair. How did I eventually get sleep? (Besides micro sleep) Along with some other things I’ll mention, I finally found a medication combo that worked which is Mirtazapine (Remeron), Temazepam/Klonopin, Melatonin, a little weed (2 hours before bedtime) and a high dose of quality CBD. Now I take tolerance breaks from these meds and my sleep is a little shaky but the meds I use on my T break is Trazodone, CBD, Weed and Magnolia Bark. I’m hoping therapy will help me ween off the meds and switch to only natural remedies. We know the risk potential with Benzos so use them only when you absolutely need them, and if you get to that point, the pros outweigh the cons. But still don’t take them daily for long periods of time.

Retraining your circadian rhythm is a big factor if you’ve gone weeks without sleep. If your circadian rhythm was so out of wack like mine I suggest you get sunlight in the morning whenever you “wake up” and caffeine early in the morning, obviously not near bed time. It tells your body this is when you should wake up. Now before you lay down to go to sleep at night, stay up as long as you possibly can before your body starts to give in, aka sleep restriction therapy, and then add in the medication. Make sure your occupying your time with fun and mellow activities during this time and minimal blue light. If you suffer from OCD tendencies or negative thought patterns I highly recommend and OTC supplement NAC to take in the daytime. One of the biggest keys is to make sure to supplement with Creatine, Vitamin BCD, Fish Oil, Magnesium, Zinc, Fiber and a TON of water as your body gets depleted of these quicker during long bouts of insomnia especially Vit B, creatine and water. Try to be as healthy as possible to counteract the negative health effects from insomnia, exercise is crutial but don’t over do it. Get really nice earplugs and therapy can really help as well. A lot of people don’t understand insomnia so having a therapist to vent about it to is helpful.

I believe 98% of peoples insomnia stems from some form of trauma in their life, or just gradually built up depression, or both. One of the most important thing I mention is to remind yourself that your insomnia is caused by the trauma and is a normal reaction to it. No need to put blame on yourself, some things are out of our control. 

Other meds I’ve tried-

Seroquel- This is a god send for some and definitely makes you tired but it’s feel weird type of tired that keeps me up. 

Trazodone- Not terrible, it works sometimes but not when anxiety is high. 

Hydroxyzine- Worked a few times then stopped.

Ambien- Works when paired with benzo be careful with doses.

Magnesium/Melatonin/CBD/Theanine- Hopefully I’ll get to a point where these are all I need but not currently.

Phenibut/Gabapentin- GABA-B antagonists give me sort of energizing feel so didn’t work well the few times I tried it. Don’t use daily.

Kratom- Really good natural remedy for depression. Don’t use daily.

It like me trying to tell you to understand my dyslexic brain when you have a “regular” brain.

He has tried melatonin for months, increased his dosage and it didn’t work. 

His doctor put him on Benadryl, 2 a night, he upped that to 4 at night and 6 melatonin. Still shit sleep. Or tossing and turning. Or laying there awake. 

Now he’s on Temazepam, for the first time last night. It took 2 hours to hit and still shit sleep. Tossing, turning, laying awake then hella drowsy unable to function in the morning. 

In the time span that we’ve been together I’ve only seen him sleep one night, and that was the night after I took him with me to rock climb. His body was exhausted and he slept the entire night. 

I started making him cordycepts tea and that seems to turn off his ADHD brain and make him feel tired. Now something has to keep him asleep at night.

edit: fuck weed still seems like the healthiest way to cope with my insomnia versus sleep AIDS like dph which are horrible for your mind long term and benzos which are just very physically addictive. marijuana also helps with regulating meals and my schedule in general but for me its either all in or all out and its hard for me to just use weed before bed. hopefully i can get adjusted to my natural circadian rythym again because this shit is fuckedd and not the first time i've struggled with it. one of the big reasons i continually return to drugs because i get anxious about not being able to sleep which snowballs and snowballs. ugh",Temazepam
1136,"Covid insomnia > any other insomnia Well this is the real deal lemme tell you.  After dealing with chronic and persistent insomnia for the past 9 years, I think I've reached the holy grail of insomnia battles.

I'm about a week in.  I think I've slept a total of 6 hours in the past 7 days.  My insomnia meds (Temazepam) are literally laughing at me as I take them each night.  I can't do OTC stuff due to RLS.  I can't do benadryl because of RLS.  I can't do night time cough and cold medicine because of RLS.  I don't smoke weed.  CBD has no effect on me.  Melatonin LOL.

I'm not so sick that I'm keeping myself awake.  I'm not anxious about this to the point of causing problems with my sleep.  I'm doing all the same things I've done before that used to work.

1137,"More random thoughts about insomnia So it's 6am on Saturday morning.  I've been up now since Thursday.  This is nothing.  I do this without blinking.  Every month I typically have a 2.5 day run without sleep and that isn't even difficult for me any longer.

I think I've finally reached the end of the road with my current meds.  I'm on Temazepam 30mg and have been taking it for about a year and a half now.  Out of the 7 different prescription meds I've taken, this one was the best.  But now I can take a handful and it doesn't do a thing.

I've taken everything and I have no idea what to even suggest to my doc.  Ambien, Trazadone, zolpidem, lunesta, doxepin, sonata, and currently Temazepam.  Some of the meds gave me horrible side effects, some just flat out didn't work.

And I know this is the insomnia group so we all get each other but I always like to mention this for the newbies - Yes, I sleep in a comfortable room.  Yes, I have nice pillows.  No, I dont watch tv or use electronics in bed.  Yes, I've tried melatonin.  Yes, I crank the air so everything is nice and cold.  Yes, it's dark. No, I don't drink caffeine too late.",Temazepam

Tonight I have taken it with several tablets of melatonin(which never works for me anyway) and, of course, I’m still awake. Is it even supposed to work? It’s specifically for sleep?? At this point I’m starting to doubt anything can make me sleep normally. The best sleeps I’ve had have been under anesthetic honestly. Even being blackout drunk doesn’t keep me down for very long.

Personally I used alcohol but it’s counter productive. It actually causes insomnia long term. Then I discovered kiwi fruit. Here’s my notes on kiwi usage to battle insomnia

* Kiwi won’t make you fall asleep, but if you are tired and just not quite able to get over the hump they’ll work.
* Kiwi will **not** work if you are not tired, you have to be tired first
* Take 2 kiwi half an hour before wanting to sleep. The timings seem important. If you push through that magic 30 min time, to say 60 mins, then the effect is gone
* Immature, sour, tough kiwi seems to work best. Soft & ripe is almost useless. Get tough, young, kiwi
* smaller kiwi seems to be more potent than large kiwi. 
* strong green colour seems to work best, avoid yellow kiwi
* kiwi is not 100% effective but I find it like 90% effective
* kiwi won’t help in uncomfortable sleeping conditions. You need to have correct temperature and lighting for example

That’s what I’ve found from years of using kiwi now to sleep.",Temazepam

Last Wednesday I was prescribed 20mg - 40mg of Restoril (Temazepam) I had to take 1x cap 20mg and another 1x cap 20mg after two and half hours if it didn't give the desired effect.

Restoril doesn't really give the desired effect that I was hoping for. I still experience difficulty falling asleep and also still wake up middle in the night after a hour or 2 of sleep. By that time I'm wide awake and have trouble falling asleep again.

1149,"Any tips for dealing with morning sedation? My sleep is fuuuuuuuucked.

 My GF rolls out of bed at 5:15, there's probably Peter Gynt playing, perhaps a morning bird alights on her arm to greet the new day.

Meanwhile if my alarm goes off any time before 10 I'm just like ""Fuck. I want to figuratively off myself"". How many hours I got doesn't matter, all that matters is the time.

This is probably due to all the meds I take the night before. About 4 years ago I suddenly lost my sleep reflex. Every time I would step up to a new dosage the problem would go away but eventually reappear. Without meds I would be up for 3-4 days at a time, I don't sleep until I take my meds. It's not even a cognitive thing, I feel the sleep pressure, lay down in bed, but sleep never comes.

A casual 25mg of Seroquel became 300mg, 45mg of Remeron, 15mg of Temazepam, and 3mg of melatonin. 

The effect of all this in the morning is basically a black hole. My alarm goes off at 9 but I can't get out of bed until 10 without an imminent threat of being fired or something, even then I'm frequently late. I do all my own scheduling now though so I never have the power to fight it so I just roll over and pass right back out.

I'm not kidding when I say it is like being tranquilized. You could sit there and explain the situation to me, that I got my hours, that I'll be fine in an hour, that I need to get started on the day, that going back to sleep isn't good for my sleep hygiene, anything. Nothing works. 

I've been put under for many surgeries, and I feel just as sedated as I did waking up after the operation.

It makes me feel like shit sitting there making breakfast in my bathrobe at 11am. Ideally I want to push my 9 am (effectively 10:30am because I ignore my alarm) wake up back to 7. 

Any ideas? Decreasing any of my meds is not an option. I've tried probably a dozen times. Cutting even a milligram results in me just not sleeping again. I've tried staggering the melatonin earlier but even as it is I can hardly even finish my nighttime routine before my meds kick in. 

I'm otherwise a totally healthy 24 year old woman. I run 3x weekly, meditate daily, my jobs aren't physical but also aren't very sedentary. I'm vegetarian and eat very well. I don't smoke and rarely ever drink anything that isn't water. I take a Focalin after breakfast at about 11am, and have a cup of coffee or tea no later than 2 pm on drug holiday days.",Temazepam

1151,"Trazadone can't breath through nose I have been on trazadone for about 5 years, I need to take between 225 and 300mg every night. It has always stuffed my nose up a little bit but nothing bad. Recently it's gotten so bad that less than 15 minutes after taking it I simply can't breathe through my nose. It never gets runny just completely closes. Whenever I wake up my mouth is completely dry. Like dry to the touch dry. It seems my mouth doesn't even attempt to salivate while asleep. My tongue has cracked and bled before it's so bad. It's extremely difficult to even manage taking a sip of water without at least my lips cracking and bleeding.
My doc tried me on Lunesta, no good for sleep and a horrible taste in my mouth that lasted about 15 hours. It made eating very difficult which is no good for me either, I'm underweight.
Currently trying temazepam 15mg and it doesn't work for sleep at that dose. It's a benzo and I read it's not good for long term use... I obviously need something longterm and if it doesn't work at this dose idk how high of a dose I would eventually need.
The trazadone is a life saver minus the side effects. In doing some research I realized it is probably the culprit for my accelerated hair loss. That's really a moot point after the damage done by lithium a while ago, and the one they had me on after that plus genetics. Also explains a very low sex drive which came back really quick after stopping.
I don't care about the hair loss I've been shaving for years anyway. Don't really mind the sex drive thing since I didn't even notice it until I stopped. I do however need to be able to breath at night.
Before stopping the trazadone I tried different otc decongestants with no luck.
I'm afraid that no other sleep med can help me as well as trazadone. It's a blessing to know I can sleep no matter what after taking it, knowing that helps keep me sane during the day and I don't have that luxury anymore.

I'm writing to inquire about how to go about some of my sleep issues I've had for roughly 10+ years and now that I'm 25 coming up soon I just can't function like I used to. Getting the worse side effects lately. Memory loss, impatient, irritated easily, clumsiness, off balance, slur words in sentences at times, and overall an extremely overwhelming feeling of ALWAYS being tired.

I've done a home sleep test to rule out sleep apnea and bloodwork many times to check if all my tests were normal and they are. I try going to bed same time most nights.

I've recently tried Temazepam 7.5 mg and that worked for sleeping 5 hours straight and I was happy enough with it but since it didn't quite reach 6+ I asked for maybe a stronger dosage. They doubled it to 15mg and that didn't even remotely make me feel tired anymore. I was so confused. 

Now I'm trying Ambien generic version zolpidem for 5mg (not the extended release version) and it made me drowsy quickly and I fell asleep just fine. Now only issue is I only slept 2 hours before waking up. Then I would eventually fall asleep again but wake up and repeat 4 times over the next 2 hours. And now as I write this I am still awake after taking my pill. Total sleep is around 3.5 hours max. 

I've tried pairing both temazapam and ambien with these hemp extract gummies people swore made them sleepy, no effect. 

I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Should I get zolpidem CR for extended release and if so should I try 10mg instead of the 5mg which wasn't working well?  OR should I just bite the bullet and find some sort of sleep specialist of center?

However, in the past years, I have began to develop far better sleep hygiene, exercise routine, diet, and sleep schedule.  The problem still remains, though, that I can't get to sleep within an hour.  I've heard that the average person gets to sleep within 20 mins (must be nice), but I just can't.  Furthermore, when I wake up to pee, I then lose another hour just for that.  Taking melatonin does nothing but make me more groggy, and temazepam works but significantly reduces the quality of my sleep to the point where it has no real benefit.

I'm a bit concerned over dependency and of effects wearing off, though only the temazepam has had an increased dose and that was within 2 weeks of starting and that was 9 months ago.

The xanax was originally for anxiety (autistic teen son) but it works for insomnia. I'm not sure it's really meant for that though.

Temazepam and xanax both give vivid dreams which are usually ok (ie not nightmares) but I can sometimes wake from an intense dream feeling like I've had an exhausting day! It does wear off before too long though.

Diphenhydramine and doxycycline just make me sleepy the entire following day, even at a half dose.

The Dr did have me on, I think, lorazepam but it did nothing for me. Melatonin did nothing at night but gave me a hangover the next day, even on a minimal dose.

I can buy indica edibles here legally but there's still that stigma over them. Frankly they seem to work better with fewer side effects than regular medicine. I'm just concerned at long term effects and any drug tests I might need for whatever reason, and I can't travel with them.

I've always had a bit of issues with Insomnia in the past. But over the last few months, it feels especially bad; and I'm almost certain it's all triggered by anxiety, as I've gone to my primary care doctor multiple times already, and what treatment he gives seems to work little, and what tests he's run has shown nothing abnormal.

When I'm laying in bed, I usually try different things to wear myself down mentally. Be it thinking creatively, composing mini-stories in my head, be it thinking positively, to mute out repetitive anxiety with instead ""I will get better,"" or ""I will sleep."" Be it counting slowly in my head, be it focusing on my breathing. They help at first, until all at once, I think when I'm on the cusp of sleep, my brain suddenly fires up again with anxious thoughts, and leaves me with a plethora of physical symptoms that makes me think something is medically wrong with me.

Heart palpitations, heat flashes, tremors, weakness, racing thoughts and feelings of doom. And all at once, I'm shocked awake again, unable to focus except on how bad I feel in that moment. And then I spend hours trying to calm to little help, until I finally cave, take a Temazepan... and have it usually not work, requiring me to take two and hope it just knocks me out. (For reference, 1 pill is 15mg, so 2 would be 30mg)

I'm doing so many things to physically try and help myself. Since so much of my anxiety is stemmed from my health, I've been making efforts to improve it. Daily exercise, eating better, going to doctors more regularly. But nothing seems to stop this anxiety and insomnia. It's gotten to a point that when I'm awake, I can't stop thinking about \*if\* I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

I'm hoping talking with my psychiatrist helps. I'm thinking maybe medicines needs changing, I take Trintellix and Vraylar right now, but I feel like while my depression has not hurt me so badly, my anxiety now rules me. The fact Temazepam seems to only work at max dosage also shakes me. It'll make my body tired, but my thoughts and fears and symptoms remain.

I'm mostly writing this as a form of venting, though if people have advice or recommend questions I could bring up to the psychiatrist, I'm very much all ears.

1162,"Insomnia as a side effect of anxiety disorder I apologize for the long post, but I really need help. Over the past month, my insomnia has come back slowly. Two weeks ago it hit the first peak, I went to sleep at 6:30am and woke up at around 9:30 or 10, so I made an appointment with my doctor immediately as I don’t currently go to therapy but I knew I was going to have to start going. My GP referred me to a psychologist in the practice and she determined I needed more help than she could give me so she sent me to a mental health practice where I will be evaluated and given the treatment I need. My GP also prescribed sleeping pills (temazepam, 20mg), she gave me 10 pills but advised me to only take them until I felt comfortable enough to sleep without them. That point never came as the effectiveness of the pills varied from one night to the next, some nights I would sleep like a baby and the next I would stay awake in my bed for hours. Long story short, I took the pills for 9 days, my boyfriend came over to my place and this helped me sleep better for the 3 nights he was with me (I only took melatonin, one day I took 9mg and the other 2 days I took 3mg). I have one sleeping pill left that I don’t want to spend because other than that I won’t have anything else to help me sleep. 
The first night after my boyfriend left (last night) I stayed awake in my bed from about 11pm until 5am, and couldn’t sleep at all, at which point I moved to my very uncomfortable couch and was able to fall asleep eventually, I managed to sleep about 2 hours (until 7:30 or 8). I am feeling utterly helpless and obviously tired, I tried sleeping after I woke up in the living room but I couldn’t anymore. 
Some info about my living conditions: I live near a church so the bell from the church rings every 30 minutes and I can hear it perfectly, and this helps my brain keep track of how many hours I’ve failed to sleep. Before I moved to the country where I live now (over a year ago), I also had sleeping issues but I would go to therapy regularly and I also took a lot of melatonin, valerian root and magnesium each night to help me sleep, here, these things are both expensive and extremely hard to find. I try to take “sleep tea” every night before sleeping to help my body get in the sleeping mood, then I read a book until I get sleepy enough to sleep. Sometimes this point never comes because my anxiety keeps me alert the whole time.

1165,"Hormonal factors: Insomnia My insomnia first began 3 years ago.

Before this, I was a light sleeper. I never had any real issues falling asleep.. eventually. However, I have always had hormonal issues since puberty. Such as PMS, severe pains, pcos diagnosis etc. 

In the past they hadn't affected my ability to sleep unless I was in a lot of pain. I noticed that 3 years ago my period had vanished around the same time I was experiencing some severe digestive issues. 

I had extreme bloating, and I was unable to release my bowels properly. Even on a diet that was high in fluids and easily digestible foods. This problem has been persisent until maybe 3 months ago. I was on a vegan diet which may have triggered such issues (SIBO) 

My period was absent for 6 months, and even upon it returning the insomnia did not get better. In fact, the endo pains were the worst they've ever been. The pattern I have noticed is a week before my period, I literally cannot sleep at all. And I mean, I will go for full days with no sleep. 

After not sleeping for days at a time, if I do eventually sleep it is for a couple of hours, then that night I may not sleep again. This can send me into somewhat of a psychosis or constant state of panic because my body can't regulate stress / engage with reality. 

Much of that is to be expected when the body is weak and unable to heal / rest. To not sleep is torture. I have lost my ability to work because of this major reason, among some other health issues I am facing. Sleep is too inconsistent to be reliable and alert.

My sleep problem is by far the most insidious issue I have had to date. Without sleep, the body cannot heal. What I can't understand is why would the body deny itself of the very thing it needs the most?

I haven't successfully been able to control it through diet, exercise, or meditations. I've tried some of the strongest natural medicines, melatonin, magnesium, things like ashwaghanda, 5htp, rhodiola, gaba, scullcap, valerian, liquid kava, various Chinese herbs etc. 

The sedative pharmaceutical options made me really aggressive - temazepam etc. The only thing that works for me at the moment is lorazepam (ativan) which is extremely difficult to consistently attain. I am thankful for the benzos, but I'm also afraid of the long term effects.

A strange thing I have noticed: Before I started having these issues I could lay in bed at night and visualise or imagine scenes in my mind. I could use these ""movie like"" inages to drift off to sleep or enter relaxation mode. 

Now, (and over the last 3 years) I've lost my ability to visualise things in my mind. I believe it is called Aphantasia. I literally lay there and hear words in the forefront of my mind.


And so the cycle continues... One week before my period I cannot sleep, the week of my period I cannot sleep; Stress, hbp, endometriosis pains and fibro flare ups. Then the week after I feel extremely drained, not enough sleep if any (5 hours or so)

> My blood work is relatively normal. Surprise surprise 🙄 however, my progesterone is a bit low? I am treating it with supplements. I am always slightly anemic no matter what I eat. In the past my iron was the same, but i was sleeping fine. So it's not that. I recently had a CT scan that showed a slightly enlarged thyroid.

I'm wondering if I should have extensive tests done. I had regular tests that showed nothing abnormal.. But I have heard that the current blood testing screen (Australia) rarely shows anything relevant to the conditions we can have.

Over the last 5 years I have been clean eating with no alcohol, no drugs or cigarettes, no caffiene or processed sugars / foods. I eat whole foods and organic produce, I take a lot of supplements and teas. I exercise as much as I can. Cannabis makes me more mentally alert at night unfortunatley and cbd oil does something similar.

I am really at a loss here. I suffer extreme fatigue, vision problems and dizziness along with the insomnia. On days I don't sleep my muscle weakness and lack of equilibrium makes it difficult to leave the house.

1166,"Please let me know I’m not alone. I can’t fall asleep, even with meds, but once I’m asleep I can sleep for 24+ hours I’m desperate at this point, as my sleep has made it impossible to even look for work. 

I’ve been prescribed temazepam, I’ve been prescribed quetiapine, I’ve taken up to 60+ mg of melatonin at a time and nothing can put me down. I’ll lie down in bed at midnight and not fall asleep until after 9am. I’ve cut out caffeine completely for over a year, I don’t use screens before bed, I’m hydrated, I exercise and I just cannot fall asleep.

It’s been a lifelong issue that I sleep like the dead when I do get to sleep, and it’s almost impossible to wake me up. It’s like my body wants me to be awake for around 48 hours straight and then sleep for 18 hours, which just isn’t compatible with anything in life.

I’ve tried the sleep hygiene stuff, its not working. So I have two questions that I hope my fellow insomniacs can give me some insight too:

During the day I’m so fucking tired and tense from the lack of sleep, what’s the best way to deal with that so you can hopefully sleep better the following night: do nothing and pamper yourself (ie try to take a nap, read, watch tv etc) or do a lot of activity to tire yourself out (ie work on computer, excercise, go for walks, clean the appartment etc)?

Secondly: I have steered clear of sleeping meds so far, but I do have two ‘just in case’: benadryl and temazepam (restoril in the states). Which one would be the best to start with, just to try and get a good night sleep and break this pattern?

Thanks in advance for your advice. And I apologize for any spelling errors, English is not my native language and it’s so hard to focus rn.",Temazepam

She thinks sleep apnea but I have none of the symptoms. She didn't even ask me about my sleep when she said that.

She also ordered an insomnia test, that I have to go in for. I can't sleep without meds so I'll fail that hands down. It's during the day.

Mirtazapine at lower doses helps my sleep but I need it for the depression so I need a higher dose. Trazodone left me depressed and didn't fully work. Lunesta made me depressed and suicidal. Atarax used to work but now it's not. Temazepam works but she's against it. Who is ok with lunesta but not temazepam? Whatever.

If it's not sleep apnea what can a sleep study tell her? What exactly is an insomnia test? They said something about trying to sleep for half an hour and seeing if you fall asleep. That's not going to happen. People can fall asleep on command? During the day? I'm doing it at 5pm.

Sleep medication I've taken: Melatonin, valerian root, ambien, ativan, Temazepam, lunesta, Zaleplon, Trazodone, Restoril, 
Doxepin, anything over the counter.  I think that's all. With the exception of Temazepam and Melatonin, the meds have given me either adverse side effects or absolutely no relief at all.

Currently taking: 1 30mg Temazepam per night

Current issues: Trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, multiple nights per week without any sleep, restless leg.

I have a dark room, big bed, comfy pillow, cold.  I stop screens at an hour before bed.  I only use the bed for sleep and sex.  I don't watch tv in bed.

I do all of this because it's easier to get it all out up front.  Anyways, I post because I want to receive some guidance on my next journey.  I've been dealing with the same sleep doctor for many years now and he's done a great job at helping me.  But this past visit on Thursday we basically reached the end of the road.  He told me that he really is out of options and he is not sure what to do next.

So I'm now wondering what should I do next.  I'm currently dealing with the worst stretch of insomnia I've ever deal with in my life over the last three weeks.  I'm averaging about 10 hours of sleep per week.  Typically I have two nights back to back where I don't sleep at all.  For example this past Tuesday I woke up at 5 and then didn't fall asleep until Thursday at 630am.  

I just really don't know what to do.  I've done blood work and my primary care doctor identified some areas I need to work on.  I'm trying to eat a healthy diet.  I avoid caffeine at all past 11am.  

I can't continue to live like this.  It's literally driving me into the ground.  If anyone sees a med I could try or something else that has worked for you, please let me know.  Thanks for reading",Temazepam
1177,"I just want sleep 😭 I’ve been an insomniac since middle school- didn’t start being properly medicated until my late 20’s. Early 20s I would use my anxiety medication I was prescribed to be able to sleep until I stopped taking klonopin. I’ve tried: sleepy time teas, waking up early, being active throughout the day to try to “wear myself out” any and every OTC sleep aid, melatonin, Kava tea- you name it I’ve tried it. 

A few years ago after going to my primary doctor and doing a sleep journal for a couple months per his instructions I was finally prescribed Ambien which worked so long as I didn’t eat four hours prior to taking it. It didn’t work alone though- I still had to take an OTC sleep aid in conjunction with the Ambien. After a couple years on it I’d have broken sleep- waking up having panic attacks, and sleep paralysis. 

Now I talked to my psychiatrist about this along with the panic attacks and he prescribed restoril/temazepam which I thought would be for when I panic attacks would wake me up (that worked GREAT) & come to find out no, he took me off of the ambien my primary prescribed and the pharmacist would no longer fill my ambien. So now I’m on restoril which is a benzodiazepine that I would have to go into a detox to stop taking! If I was asked for my input I’d suggest raising my dose of ambien and stay far from a benzo to take every night. Now, the restoril is no longer working and I’m at the end of my rope & not falling asleep until the sun is coming up- adding to my anxiety.

1182,"Onset of insomnia with WFH/ unable to get past the initial stages of sleep For what it's worth, I am 33, non-smoker/ light drinker, medium /athletic built and not on any medication.

&#x200B;

I've been WFH since COVID began and while at first it seemed like a paid vacation, I believe it is responsible for all or most of my insomnia. My schedule prior to this was:

wake up at 530am, work from the office from 7am to 330pm, get back home around 430pm, power nap at 5pm for 20 or so minutes and relax all evening, before hitting the sack at 11pm.

While I only got 6.5hrs during the night, I made up for it with my power nap which tops me up, and gives me energy for the evening's tasks. 

This has been my schedule for the better part of three years. While I did experience the odd bout of insomnia here and there, it has never been this bad, or this long lasting. 

However, with WFH, I've been unable to fall asleep until 3 to 4am- or this morning, 5am. My ability to nap and catch up on sleep has also completely deteriorated, and I have not had a single nap in the past two or so months. Including times in which I forced myself to nap in a blacked out room for over 4 hours to no avail.

This has of course caused me further stress and anxiety, especially as I started working out 4x a week, coincidentally around the same time this all began, and I fear that I won't have energy the next day for an enjoyable workout. 

And if I were to force myself to work out on 4 to 5 hours of sleep, it seems to just exacerbate my insomnia as I am now too tired to fall asleep. 

**My insomnia comes in the following form:**

My go-to way of falling asleep has been ""talking to myself"" with my inner voice or coming up with a fantasy scenario. With this tactic, I can almost immediately feel myself start dozing off, as my head starts to feel heavy and breathing slows down. As my eyes and my mind relax, I begin to enter a half asleep state, where I have a sort of pseudo dream- a completely random scene that plays out. 

Then without fail, just as I begin this pseudo dream, I am aroused awake and start from the beginning all over again. Often times, when I enter this dream state, I will get a hypnic jerk or wake myself up with a loud snort or a startled breath.

Then by some miracle when I do fall asleep, I usually end up waking up several times a night in short bursts. Often times, I am able to doze back out, but sometimes, it will take me an hour or so, or even cause me to get up, completely. 

This is excruciating. 

I can lie there for hours ( last night it was 6 hours) going in and out of this dream state. It is as if there is some force preventing me from just dozing off, against all the wishes of my tired mind. I wish there was a way to resolve this, but nothing short of  15mg Temazepam  is helping- and even then, it doesn't always work. 

Does anyone else get the same symptoms of insomnia? And is there anything I can do to prevent it? I am seeing a GP next week, but any help is appreciated. 

So far I have :

Practiced turning off electronics 30 mins before bed (shifting further out to an hour)

Not eating 3 hours before bed

Chatting with my wife/ letting my mind relax

Attempted to clear my mind and not play out my usual fantasy scenarios

Used ear plugs and eye cover

At first my insomnia was horrible but falling asleep became easier and easier, though I never felt like I slept, like ever. 
Always waking up several times throughout the night and even if I never recalled waking up throughout the night, I never felt like I got any sleep. 

I am using 2 grams of sensoril ashwagandha, 3 grams of L theanine and I have a protein shake consisting of ether bone broth or marine colegen (or both) and I no longer feel like I dont get sleep, but falling asleep when I need too sleep and wake up at a certain time is very difficult so I am trying too figure out a knock out combo with no withdrawl effects, tolerance, negative side effects.

I just started using Kratom and after a few weeks I now feel withdrawal effects at night, which is what I wanted too avoid, so scrapping the kratom idea.

Ive used passion flower but it never really done much, I am a male and avoid anything that can affect my testosterone so I avoid camomile and valarian root and lemon balm for the thyroid issue it causes.

Next I plan on maybe trying a mix of magnolia bark, blue skull cap and passion flower, but ultimately I feel like I am just drawing at straws, knowing they are all the short straw and nothing is going too work as well as Temazepam ever did.. 

I've tried the Gaba B3 combo molecule, I am unsure if it worked well or not.
Melatonin powder is something I plan on buying from ebay and hoping the addition is useful.

So I've been doing as much as I can to improve my diet, exercise early in the day, be social, and practice good sleep hygiene.

I've posted on here many times before. I have several inflammatory health problems which are made worse by insomnia. 

I have PTSD from a traumatic childhood and had several bouts of insomnia during my childhood and occasionally in my early 20s. At 26, I went through a very stressful time and started taking benadryl to help me sleep. This stopped working about two years ago and I started taking benzodiazepines routinely and going to therapy. I kept telling doctors that I thought the problem might be hormonal but kept getting shooed off. I'm thinking again that it probably is hormonal and my current GP thinks so too.

However, at this point, I've come off benzodiazepines  (no significant withdrawals from long-term Klonopin) and still really struggling to sleep and my health is struggling because of this. I went through several GPs until I found one who would work with me but I feel like even she is at the end of her rope.


Below is the list of medications I've taken:
* Benadryl: no longer works/has a paradoxical effect
* Unisom: makes me sleepy and has an anxiolytic effect on me but I feel like I'm sleepy but can't turn off a ""switch.""
* Lunesta. 4 hrs of sleep. Got the metallic taste in my mouth. Only 5 mg would put me out. No sleepwalking side effects. Felt like the sleep was a deep sleep.
* Ambien. 2 hrs of sleep. Takes 10 mg to put me out.  No side effects/felt slap-happy the next day as if I slept but not a deep sleep.)
* Remeron: Made me very groggy. Horrible side effects even at 7.5 mg. Caused super dry skin and the feeling of skin burning + dry eyes and mouth.
* Xanax. Worked great of course.
* Klonopin. Works fantastic at low doses (0.25 to 0.5 mg) if paired with an antihistamine. I took this long-term with antihistamines and it worked really well for me.
* Ativan. Doesn't make me sleepy. Just took it to taper/prevent withdrawal symptoms when first came off benzos.
* Temazepam. Horrible reaction. For some reason, I metabolize this really fast and start going into withdrawal between nights. I've never had this reaction to a benzo before.

Natural stuff I take:
>> l theanine 
>> GABA
>> Magnesium glycinate


I have experimented with diet and a whole host of other things. For some reason, the only thing that will really put me out now is an antihistamine matched with something that acts on GABA. 

I have tried phenibut with antihistamines and this works well but I don't like the feeling that phenibut gives me. I feel ""out"" of it.

1199,Any tips Hello! I am 26 years old and I have been struggling with horrible anxiety for the last six months and as a result have had bad insomnia. I work almost full time and I go to school and it’s kinda ruining my life. Not sleeping makes me symptoms worse and the more sleepless nights I get the more I just expect them to happen now. I was hospitalized back in June for my anxiety(had a horrible panic attack and felt like I was dying) I am now on lexapro and just was prescribed temazepam. Some people call it psycho physiological insomnia. I’ve tried therapy I’ve tried every thing and I’m fed up and I feel like I’m going to loose my job. It seems like every time I have somewhere I need to be I can’t sleep the night before. I do think it stems from a bad night that I had where I didn’t sleep all night and had to work and I felt like I was just present and wasn’t fully there. Now I just fell into this vicious cycle of not sleeping. And when I say not sleeping I’m saying not sleeping... like at all. I work in a resturant and have worked there for over 8 years and I worry that if I quit I won’t find a job that will put up with my issues aka my mental health because to most jobs it’s not a “serious issue” I just want to know if anyone else experienced this and what tips do you have for getting through it and having a “normal” day to day. Thank you in advanced.,Temazepam

To give some background; I am a 31 Y/O Divorced Mother of 2 kids (10 &amp; 6), had a emergency Gallbladder removal in 2017, Sever Sinus Infections are common for me. Idk what else would be relevant, except that I have crap ass “Accidental” Insurance or whatever.

- Major Depressive Disorder
- Anxiety
- Adult ADHD
- PTSD
- Insomnia
- Mild OCD 


Here is what I have tried &amp; the Avg. results (bed @ 10/10:30pm &amp; attempting to awake at 6am):

- Xanax (.75mg): I get about 2-3 hours of ‘good’ sleep and the rest is restless sleep. 

- Restoril (Temazepam 30mg): 2 hours of ‘good’ sleep, the rest is absolutely restless. I also tend to sleep eat or sleep eat. Sometimes I am ‘awake’ but not much in control of what I am doing. 

- Therapy: helps to vent, but I had to stop going a couple months ago, bc insurance doesn’t help &amp; it’s expensive. 

- Stop consuming Caffeine after 4: Kind of helps. 

- Stop consuming Caffeine after 12/1: Same as above. 

- Lowering the Sugar Intake (especially in the afternoon: Same, kind of helps. 

- Lowering my Carb intake: Definitely helped, I was getting a lot less sleep before. 

- Mild exercise before bed: Helps to fall asleep, but not to stay asleep. 

- THC: Whilst visiting a sister in WA, I used every night and goooood lord it helped me get so much great sleep. BUT IT IS NOT LEGAL WHERE I AM. UGH. 

- CBD: 
*Oil (300mg) you swish around in your mouth...nothing. 
*Inhaling(300mg): No help. 
*Capsules (500 mg each): 2 hours at double the dosage.

I know we don't like to compare handicaps on this thread, but I would consider myself to be on the bad end of this insomnia battle. 4 Years into the battle, I've been seeking medical help for the past 6 months. Unmedicated I will usually run over night with no sleep, even though I lay in bed 10 hours a night, completely still and eyes closed. Nice bed, cold room, black out curtain, fan on. And when I do sleep I get a half hour to 1.5 hours and that's it, once I wake there's no chance of falling back asleep until the next night, and even then I may be up over night and this never lets up. And yes,  im totally miserable and struggling to maintain my life. Xanax or temazepan works great, take it at night and wake up 5 or 6 hours later with all the energy in the world until the end of the night the next night. The doc won't prescribe it for me again because it isn't considered a long term solution. We settled with mirtazipine, an anti depressant. Seems to put me to sleep for 4 hours, wake up and take a piss and I fall back asleep for 2 or 3 more hours. Problem is, I wake up still not wanting to get out of bed and have no energy. Not like when I take temazepam or xanax. Anyways when I'm relaxing before bed I notice the heart murmurs that I can predict and during the day I have heavy hand feet and armpit sweat, it comes in waves even when I'm just sitting down. Any one wants to talk about symptoms or whatever let's talk. I'm afraid the mirtazapine is making me feel like a zombie, but even still it makes for a better day than weeks of only sleeping a half hour each night, I often felt hopeless in those times.

1206,"A debilitating malady I've lived with since 12 years old: input to situation would be appreciated. I've been dealing with chronic primary insomnia since twelve years old. For years I self medicated (in 7th grade, before psychoactive substances) melatonin was highly efficacious. I'm 26 now, so fourteen years is quite possibly the second biggest albatross in my life. I had a hx of addiction to heroin, however I quit 5 years ago. Due to this, it was incredibly difficult to attain the only medication which has yielded results (temazepam). I had been on cocktails, the most exorbitant while I was recovering from my addiction for about a year. A list made of 10mg of haldol, 120mg of elevil, .4mg clonidine, 100mg of vistoril, 10mg melatonin, 400mg topomax, plus the sedating effects of 100mg of lyrica and 20mg of flexeril. Thats just bad. Plus the non-narcotics all induce my RLS...a malady which renders those meds more harmful than helpful. I resorted to drinking myself to sleep because I literally had no options left. After doctors seeing the severity of my calamity, and how the lesser of two evils would be benzodiazepines,  as opposed to the corrosive affect of alcohol on most of my organs and health. Miraculously,  I recieved my first dose of 30mg bc that was what I had been on my first time taking the med in a detox center. 
Well, that was about 18 months ago. And the tolerance I have has gone up to stratospheric levels. I take 60mg some nights and still, here I am posting this at 6am after a night of lying in darkness with soothing music playing. I know I already take the maximum dose; and I also know how tenuous my ability to attain this prescription is. I am afraid of mentioning that the medication's efficacy is waning, because it is definitely better to have than for a doctor to take me off of it. Thay being said, and I have no idea how to handle this situation any more. If anyone has feedback from their experience with this sleepless-nightmare, I welcome the ever-living fuck out of it.

1208,"Question about temazepam Hello all! 
 I've never been a good sleeper but about a year ago things really got out of hand. For almost a year my insomnia has been severe and life ruining. I tried everything short of actual sleeping pills with various ups and downs, feeling like my life was being stolen, unable to work etc.

So last night I finally bit the bullet and took 10mg of Temazepam that I've had sitting around but been too anxious to take. I have a weird anxiety about taking medicine (side effects etc) but anyway...

The doctor said to take it for three nights in a row then every second night for six nights and that will reset my sleep and put me back in a normal routine.  So I took it last night and actually slept decently! 

Problem is today I feel pretty out of it, pretty groggy. Almost like I'm a tiny bit stoned. I went to my work induction and I functioned okay. Better than I would have without sleep. Do you think I will still feel this way every time I take it or is it just because I'm not used to it? I'm considering just taking half one tonight?

Also I'm a bit worried like what if the night comes when I don't take it and I just can't sleep again??  Or when I run out (I only have ten pills) and then what if the insomnia just comes back again?

Also what happens if I just use it every night long term?  It's so amazing to feel well slept and such a novelty. I can't see myself getting addicted in the sense of using it during the day because I like to feel alert and awake but would it fuck up my body and mind if I did use something long term to sleep?

1210,"Gold Plated Insomnia, the fanciest available I have insomnia. I think I might be a special case.

I imagine the sleep function in my brain as a rusty switch. My sleep switch is stuck on 'awake'. It's not broken, but it's damaged. It should be oiled and slick and ready to move, but instead it's stuck and requires brute force to move it from 'awake' to 'sleep'. The brute force is prescription medication. 

Let me make this clear.

It's not that I only sleep two hours a night. It's not that the sleep I get isn't quality sleep. It's not that I have trouble falling asleep.

I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL.

Without medication, I don't sleep. I'm simply AWAKE AWAKE AWAKE. And this ain't quality awake... after about 30 hours of awake, I enter zombie mode. And it only gets worse. 

I lose my appetite. I have to pee every five minutes. I sweat constantly. I hallucinate. I have to calculate every move I make so I don't fall down on a flat floor and break my neck.

170 hours awake is my record. I had to spend a week without meds several months ago. 

If it wasn't for gabapentin, temazepan, and Ambien, I'd be permanently fucked. Before medication, which I've only been on for about a year, I would routinely spend up to five days awake, and working a full-time job. I would have to drink myself to sleep to get any sleep at all. My doctor says that I have the worst case of insomnia that he's ever seen, personally or otherwise.

Life without sleep is a horror show. If the situation were ever to arise that sleep meds were just gone forever, then I'd be awake forever. The only solution would be to kill myself.

I'd rather have my arm chopped off, or lose my hearing, or be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life than to have been stricken with this disease of insomnia.

It started in the spring of 2013. Just some trouble getting enough sleep, at first. It got worse, and by the summer of 2015 I'd completely forgotten how to sleep. Forgetting how to sleep is like forgetting how to breathe. It's a fucking enigma.

A week ago I was down to my last three temazepams. I decided to test myself, to see if maybe, possibly, my sleep function had healed.

I gave it three days. Three days of awake, and trying to sleep at night. It didn't work. For about 70 hours I did this experiment on myself. Dozens of times I'd pick up my prescription bottle and shake it, secure with the knowledge that I still had those last three pills, and that I could take them and sleep. Insurance.

Three days and no sleep. That experiment confirmed that my sleep mechanism was still fucking off somewhere in the blue hills. 

I'd just like to know... Why? Why can't I sleep anymore? What happened? What exactly is it in my brain that's broken, and how did it break? 

It's exactly like coming down with a disease, like diabetes. Life has gone from normal to suddenly centered around medication. Medication, medication, medication. Do I have enough medication? Am I going to run out? When is my next refill? How much hell am I going to have to endure this month when I run out of medication?

I take absurd amounts of sleep medication, because my tolerance has built up... and it keeps getting higher and higher. I wonder, do diabetics develop a tolerance for insulin?

Anyway. This is my ongoing experience with insomnia. It seems permanent. If it weren't for sleep meds I would kill myself.",Temazepam
1211,"After 4 Sleepless Nights, Some Sleep Psychosis, and a New Prescription, I Finally Slept for 7 Hours Last Night - the Longest I've Slept in Months, by Far! TL;DR at the very bottom. Skip to that if you'd like the mega-condensed abstract version...but if you just want to skip the background info and get to the part about how I slept last night, then you can just scroll down to the part that says:

***so, on to the present*** 


Sorry in advance for what I suspect will be a long post. Just some background stuff I couldn't bring myself to omit.

So just for context: 

I was diagnosed with PTSD-related insomnia at 13 after fighting off an attempted assault. For a few years before that, I had already been struggling with insomnia intermittently due to a fear of sleeping at night (my mother, who was chronically suicidal, often attempted to kill herself at night, and I felt responsible for staying alert in order to thwart her...which did happen more than once when I was young). But the assault really established the insomnia as a chronic problem. Because flashbacks and nightmares and cruel thoughts and general fear. Y'all know the drill.

The insomnia was largely untreated. I tried temazepam, but it didn't help much with sleep and just made me restless and weird (weirder than usual, anyway - I was drawing bizarre things on my walls with no memory of having done so). So instead I used absurd amounts of diphenhydramine/Benadryl every night for about 8 years. The dosage eventually grew to 300+mg every night, just to sleep. Would NOT recommend. The dysphoria at that dose is almost worse than the insomnia...and it can kill you. It  never worked all that well, anyway, but even that stopped working altogether after a while. I was sleeping a little most nights, but not well and not for long. 

Then, almost exactly a decade after the attempted assault that kick-started my insomnia, and because the universe likes to just *mess* with me...I suffered a traumatic brain injury during a second (unrelated) sexual assault while working overseas. Punch in the face, and my skull ricocheted hard against a brick wall.

Unsurprisingly, the brain injury and emotional impact of the attack resulted in more PTSD. That was four years ago and it exacerbated my insomnia so much that I started sleeping only a couple days a week, and never for more than 4 hours at a time. Usually less. My physical and mental health completely tanked. Prescription and OTC drugs and therapy did nothing. Even Ambien was utterly worthless. I was basically a zombie. All the effects from the TBI became unbearable without sleep - especially the headaches, which just made it impossible to rest. I was often hit with sleep psychosis (of varying severity).

But even with the insomnia, the panic attacks, the psychosis, and the cognitive deficits, my sleep problems had never put me in the hospital. 

For tangential context on that, in case anyone is wondering why a clearly psychotic person bordering on a crisis wouldn't go the ER: 

My mother has always had a lot of severe mental illness, including frequent psychotic episodes. My dad, on the other hand,  is an MSW, a counselor with a degree in psychology, and works at an involuntary in-patient psych facility. So my mom's erratic behavior feels normalized enough in our house that we're maybe a bit desensitized. And the symptoms of sleep psychosis aren't wildly different from the usual symptoms of my own panic disorder/PTSD/TBI/depression/bipolar II, so it can be tough to spot. Even when it happens to me and it's obvious, my Dad is there to provide help and guidance. We know he shouldn't treat family members, but he can still give advice and monitor me when I snap.

***So, on to the present.***

I was admitted to the ER on Saturday with a severe panic attack after four days without sleep. I was mildly delusional, hyperventilating, very sure that I was dying, badly dehydrated, and registering a pulse above 140 BPM. I have panic attacks almost every night and some of them are pretty serious (the hyperventilating has made me pass out a few times), but this was easily the worst one ever. Sleep deprivation lowers your threshold for tolerable panic, and my legitimate fear that I was dying (or about to have a seizure, which was the truly scary bit) just made the panic even worse. Some Xanax finally brought my pulse down, they gave me fluids, and sent me home with some low-dose Ambien. I was exhausted enough from the ER visit to sleep for 2 hours before filling the Ambien script - but once I tried the Ambien, it was worth than useless. I was so desperate I took all 10 (50mg total), spaced out a bit, within 24 hours. Did nothing. Sugar pill would have been more useful than that stuff.

After being discharged, I went to my doctor and told him that my (lowest-possible-dose) Xanax, which was prescribed mainly to treat my nighttime panic attacks and thereby help me sleep, had essentially stopped working. 

I know that my doc basically refuses to prescribe sleep aids after I asked him during our first meeting  (bc they're ""too addictive,"" tho he still gives me Xanax, Tramadol, Adderall, and now Clonazepam...). So I asked if I could switch from the Xanax to Clonazepam/Klonopin, which I took years and years ago for anxiety and knew that it worked better and longer for me than the measely .25mg Xans he had me on. And I also asked to increase my gabapentin dosage, since gabapentin often helps to relax me, too.

He actually obliged. 
Guess it pays off to earn your doctor's trust (and to find a fair doc in the first place).
So I took my 2400mg of the gaba and 4mg of the Klonopin. And, omg, it worked like a charm. For the first time in months, possibly years, I actually fell asleep, relaxed, without any problems... and slept solidly from 10pm-11am. I woke up feeling a little groggy, but otherwise well-rested. And with a clear head and much-improved mood.

I am so ecstatic about this.

This is easily the most effective treatment I've ever had, after more than a decade of trying seemingly everything. Would much prefer a natural method for sleep, of course, but nothing else has ever worked. Except heavy opiates, I guess, which are OBVIOUSLY not preferable and rapidly helped destroy my life (completely, utterly destroyed). But I stopped using opiates altogether about six months ago (yay!). These sleep problems tempted me to relapse on the opiates, but now that I know this could work, it is much easier to push those urges aside.

I'm not really recommending that anyone use benzos for sleep, because they can be very addictive/dangerous, especially long-term, and they tend to be short-acting (and one should especially take care with benzos that aren't personally prescribed, or with misuing even their own prescriptions, tho I think that goes without saying)...but this has really turned things around for me, personally. 

Maybe the Klonopin (with the gabapentin - gotta give props to the gaba, too) can help turn things around. It certainly did last night. 

And, bonus? 
I had good dreams! Not fantastic dreams, but DEFINITELY not the horrific nightmares, flashbacks, and anxiety dreams I'd gotten used to. My insomnia was definitely being exacerbated by the fear of my nightly (every. single. night.) nightmares and flashbacks regarding my trauma(s), but if that fear subsides, I suspect that restful sleep will get even easier. Last night I just had some mildly pleasant adventure dreams. The kind I used to have as a kid. And I really, really missed those kinds of dreams.

Sorry for the long post, and I know this was just one night and I shouldn't get too excited...but after thousands of terrible nights, and having tried so many other methods and essentially giving up, it's still a beacon of hope.  I'm just really impressed by how well this went and I'm SO thankful that I asked my doctor to switch (and that I remembered how effective Klonopin had been years ago). Even if the Klonopin stops working after today, I'll still be glad that I got a FULL night of restful sleep for the first time in...god, forever.

And so glad that my doctor listened to me and trusted my judgement. 
(...even if I don't really trust HIS judgement for other crazy reasons that I won't get into here...)

I hope that tonight goes just as well. As a bonus, it's helping a lot with my day-to-day anxiety, too. And as a likely combination of the restful sleep, the emotional relief, and general respite from my constant anxiety/PTSD, my mood has greatly improved. I'm drawing and writing again for the first time in about two years, because I finally have the emotional wherewithal.

I hope this doesn't come across as braggy or insensitive to those of you still struggling. I just wanted to share my relief and give some hope to others who have given up on ever sleeping properly again - that maybe something out there, even something you've tried before or have written off, could turn things around. Even if it's just for one night.

Anyway. I know this may be premature. If the Klonopin (and the gabapentin, which helps as a sedative, too) fails to work again tonight or other nights, then I'll be bummed and a little embarrassed. But as it stands...just really, really grateful. I'm desperate enough to sleep that even one night feels like a miracle.

I’ve tried meditation and I’ve tried these medications (Ambien, olanzapine, Trazadone, diphenhydramine, Dramamine, melatonin, seroquel, doxylamine, Temazepam, Kava, Valerian root, etc) Its been recently brought to my attention that if I’m able to sleep way more during the day, it may be that I have something called shift-work disorder if my nights are mixed up with days.

Someone please give me some advice At the moment I'm trying to get back to sleep after having been woken up an hour into sleep by the usual - a nightmare where I explicitly experience what has traumatized me, so I don't want to go into details

I'm unable to sleep longer than 30min-1hr beca use I immediately go back into REM sleep and relive the incident in dream. The other night I woke up myself up 30min after falling asleep by swinging my arms because I was doing that for survival in the dream.

I also have some health problems that limit what I know I should take as prescribed. For example, hydeoxizine doesn't really work at all, and makes my bladder problems worse. I have chronic, very embarrassing bladder problems from essentially taking boxes of benadryl to sleep since I developed the insomnia from this incident when I was a kid. It feels like my bladder has had my final straw if I take anymore DPH or hydroxizine etc.
What I know helps me to sleep without having nightmares about the incident, and doesn't hurt my bladder are benzodiazepines. 
I'm not even asking for one of the more ""abuse able"" ones. At least temazepam. It really helps me. I just need to get back to afunctioning level where I can work and go to and school again. I essentially haven't slept in 5 days right now, unless you count each time I've fallen asleep and woke up almost exactly 30 min later from the traumatic dreams.

I've got an appijntment with a counselor or aomethinget this week about my situation. Is there anything I should say specifically so that I can at leat get a 10 night thing of temazepam?

So the last week has been without doubt the worst period of sleeplessness that I have experienced in my life. 

The last three days I feel as if I am in this stage where I am not quite asleep, but not awake either. Not the deep sleep from which you regain consciousness but a sort of limbo where im not aware of my surroundings. Possibly NREM?

Weed and a temazepam (each taken separate nights) appear not to have helped. I haven't been able to get to that deep sleep stage. 

Now my mind is just constantly tired. Not a sense of physical exhaustion, but a stage where my mind is dull and feels slow. A blanket over it. 

Is this just normal chronic Insomnia? I am worried I won't be able to sleep properly again. 

My friend gave me some Temazepam, 20mg, which worked the first few nights last week (only fourish hours) but last night did not.

1234,"Question about BPPV, panic attacks, and therapy. Hello all.  I'll try to keep this brief.  

I work in law enforcement, and about 4 years ago I took a hard hit to the head.  Ended up with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo - basically a condition where one of the ""crystals"" in your inner ear gets knocked loose, blocking the correct flow of fluid, resulting in serious vertigo (room spinning) when your head is in a certain position.

Thing is, I didn't know that till about a month after.  I would go to bed, and sometime in the night wake up with the sensation that my house was tumbling downhill...sometimes falling out of bed.  Often I would still be in the ether of sleepiness.  I only remembered a few episodes, and chalked it up to just terrifying nightmares.  That is until I was working under a car and triggered the vertigo.  Was finally diagnosed and treated.

Trouble is, it's left me with a kind of sleep PTSD.  It's as though my mind is afraid to go to sleep, for fear of that ""nightmare"" happening again.  It will result in panic attacks and disturbing subconscious images when I try to lay down to go to sleep.  I've been managing with a Zzquil and bourbon cocktail before bed every night, but that's obviously not a healthy lifestyle.

Was prescribed Temazepam for a bit, but...that was just awful.  

I'm curious about anyone's experience with therapy.  What techniques were used?  How effective was it?  Are there any other sleep aids on the market that don't have the same effects as Ambien or Temazepam?

I'm here (fresh account, have always been wary that reddit won't help me sleep!) at 6am - one day of poor sleep hygiene 5 days ago has, unfortunately, floored me.

I'm here despite my current conundrum to give advice I'm sure you've read before, but perhaps it may help a casual browser: SAD lamps. 

I've never slept well at night and yet fallen asleep without warning during the day. In secondary school teachers gave up and let me nap in lessons.

A doctor says ""just lie in bed all night!"" - er? and be with my own thoughts? Do you want me to perish? My mind runs a mile a minute in twenty different directions, there is no such thing as relaxing. 

Having been prescribed zopiclone, temazepam (and recently quetiapine?!), and self medicated with etizolam and diazepam, I must say that my saviour has been the 10,000lux box of searing light that is a SAD treatment light. I bought the cheapest one I could find and those timers that old people use to pretend they're in. I position it right next to my face. Somewhat startling, less distressing than an audio alarm.

It's the best decision I have ever made. I still occasionally have bad nights (tonight, for example, hello I am babbling on a forum I am new to, PLEASE FORGIVE ME). 

The lamp is timed to come on at 7am. For the last three years since purchase I have on average fallen asleep at *normal* times (? 11pm - 1am). I went from being awake until 11am everyday, crashing out for two hours then again and again and again to a pretty normal capacity to sleep within a month. It requires upkeep, sometimes anxiety still overrides it, if I forget, it's all gone in an instant. 

Has anyone else had luck with this? I would love to get to a point where I don't need such meticulous sleep hygiene plus the lamp, if you have been using a lamp to good effect have you been able to 'ween' off of it?

Sorry for babble - I guess I'm just here to say that sleep meds and benzos didn't help me, personally. I mean, of course they did in the short term, but with zopiclone not agreeing with me, benzos are unsustainable long term.

1241,Has anyone tried temazepam for insomnia? Hi.  My Dr prescribed temazepam for sleep.  Tonight is my first time trying it and I'm wide awake.  Maybe I'm not taking enough? She has me on 2 15mg pills. Anyone else had luck with this? ,Temazepam
1242,"Looking for some honest (brutal whatever) thoughts/suggestions So I've had issues with sleep for years (around a decade). I've mostly avoided Drs (largely due to social anxiety which is another problem along with depression that I worked hard to pretend I didn't have issues with), but have been working very hard to get over that, and have been regularly seeing a general practitioner and a psych for the last couple of years. 

I've marked a TLDR section at the bottom you can skip to.

I've tried various medications on and off to help sleep. Low dose melatonin. Diphenhydramine. Sonata (which worked great when I took it years ago). Ambien. Lunesta. Alprazolam. 

I don't take medication every night (except low dose melatonin). When I do take medication multiple nights in a row, I try to rotate through whatever I have available, as I'm worried about tolerance. (Though, honestly, I wouldn't care at all about dependence... I can't sleep. Dependence would be the least of my worries.)

I seem to have a very high natural tolerance for most medications. I assume it's genetic, because my father was the same way. Even earlier in my life when I was a die-hard anti anything remotely psychoactive... (I have some alcoholics in my gene line, some drug addicts in my non-genetic relatives, and I had some strong religious beliefs.) It would take higher than normal doses to affect me. 

When I had my wisdom teeth cut out, we paid extra to have me put under instead of the normal numbing anesthesia. (My mother is a dental hygienist and worked for the dentist that did this.) I believe they used Versed. After the IV was put in, I was left alone in the room. When the lady returned, she asked how I was feeling. I told her I didn't feel any differently than before the IV. ""You don't feel drowsy at all?"" ""Not at all. Why?"" She had a puzzled look on her face, and said half of the dose had already gone in. 

Fast forward, I was awake through the entire thing, and could quote what the dentist said about my teeth as he was removing the pieces (after he had broken them attempting to remove them which for all I know is a common thing). 

One time I was given oxycodone (Percocet) for my first instance of kidney stones. I was hesitant to take them, because of the aforementioned aversion to drugs. When the pain made me desperate enough to take what was prescribed, it did nothing. So I took another. Still nothing. As in not ""I'm still in pain"" but ""I'm still in the exact amount of pain."" So I just didn't take them anymore.

TLDR: So now currently I'm over the whole I-might-as-well-be-tom-cruise drug aversion. I've tried various medications. Sonata (for whatever reason) had the most consistent success for me, but everyone I've mentioned that to, no one prescribes it. They always want to prescribe lunesta or ambien.

The psych I have for the last couple of years suggested temazepam. 30mg. It doesn't do anything for me. I started to suggest that maybe I could try taking 60mg to see if that did anything. Before I even finished the question, he was emphatically against that. 

I then purchased a sleep tracker, so I could get some more insight/data. I typically get around 4-6hrs of sleep. 0 to 15min of deep sleep. Some nights I just don't go to sleep and stay up for two days. This can occur whether or not I take 50mg of diphenhydramine, 30mg of temazepam, or nothing at all.

Out of desperation, I decided to try an experiment. Once a week I take 60mg of temazepam. I've done this for a month. I have sleep data for every day. That one day a week, I get 7-9hrs of sleep and no less than 1hr of deep sleep. And I feel great in the morning. I think more clearly, and I can actually exercise during the day without feeling like I want to die.

So after all that (maybe I put some of you insomniacs to sleep :), my question/s is/are: is 60mg of temazepam ""insane""? Has anyone taken that amount? Are there possible combinations I should consider? Are there ways to address this with drs that don't sound like ""I want to get high"" which I get the feeling is what they infer? (I don't really understand that, as I'm asleep. What is ""high"" when you're asleep?)

1245,"What's the general process like for getting diagnosed? I've always been a ""night owl"" and the last couple of years I typically don't get tired until 2 or 3 in the morning. This was okay when I worked part time in the afternoon and could sleep in, but for the past 6 months or so, when I started working full time, it's been pretty shitty. My job varies a good bit at what time we start working, generally anywhere between 6-8:30am. 

Typically I get around 4 hours of sleep a night, though more and more it seems like I'm getting less, with more frequent occurrences of only getting 2-3 hours, and last week there was a day where I just got 1 hour and it sucked hard core. I feel lucky if I get 5 hours of sleep. 

At first I would sort of compensate by sleep for 12-15 hours on the weekends, but now even on the weekends I can't sleep nearly as much as I used to. 

I don't know if the amount of sleep I get qualifies as insomnia because I'm sure there are tons of people out there who get less sleep than I do. But recently I told my dr about it, and he gave me a very short term (like 2 weeks worth) prescription for temazepam. I've taken it a few times and it was great the first time, took me about 40 min to fall asleep and I got 7 hours of sleep. But the second time I took it, it took longer to fall asleep and I got less sleep, and last time I took it, it didn't seem to make me sleepy at all and I pretty much had a ""normal"" night. 

My main issue is how long it takes for me to fall asleep. Usually I lay in bed for hours. My dr thinks it's anxiety, but I'm not worried about stuff when I'm trying to sleep. My body is tired but my mind is not. Most of the time I'll be exhausted literally the entire day, but once the evening hits, it's like I somehow gain mental energy without doing anything. 

Anyway, my dr said if I wanted more pills (I'd like to try a different medication actually) then we'd have to go through a longer ""process"". He made it sound like it might be difficult and I don't really know what to expect, so I was wondering what other peoples' experiences with getting diagnosed have been.

I have other medical issues (simple partial seizures, anxiety, an autonomic nervous system problem that should make me tired but somehow doesn't once I get in bed. I stopped being able to even take short naps after college. I also have a unique reaction to Benadryl and Tylenol PM. As in, I can take them during the day because they don't make me fucking tired. I've had this problem sleeping ever since I can remember. I know it has to do with my anxiety as well, but I have tried just about everything to fix it. On the natural side, plenty of yoga, relaxation tapes, biofeedback, guided meditation, regular meditation, special music that's supposed to reach some special part of your brain and calm it down. Acupuncture. Neurofeedback. Hypnotherapy. Having someone ""cleanse"" my body of negative energy. There's so much more, but I've been up for 3 days so the rest escape me. I currently alternate between taking alprazolam, temazepam, and ambien. Anything else is useless. Seroquel only works sporadically. Remeron used to help but now I even stay awake through that. Rozerum sucks. I'm not doing Lunesta. I have enough nightmares to begin with, and I don't need any night terrors. The longest I've been up is, I believe, 5 days straight. I was once up, with 3 hours of sleep to keep me alive, for a total of 7 days. I'm at the point where I will literally keep taking these pills until I finally fall asleep. And I can't do that ASMR stuff. It makes me want to peel my skin off. I know at this point that benzos can have long term effects on your memory, but I'm too far into taking them, and I honestly don't give a shit as long as they can give me a few hours respite. And then there are times when I'll sleep for 13 hours straight. It makes no sense, but it's nice. I often become afraid that my lack of sleep could endanger others when I'm driving.
I used to be afraid of overdosing on my sleeping medications, but I've gotten to the point where I just don't care anymore. I just want sleep. Just a little bit.

It already seems as if she's relying heavily on the pills and she has had to increase her dosage only after 6 days on the pill.

I recommended marijuana as a solution and she is willing to try it. However, I'm worried about the risks for someone her age. She is against smoking it so I am willing to procure edibles for her.

I've taken melatonin, magnesium, GABA, valerian, OTCs like doxylamine (I need about 100mg to sleep) and diphenhydramine. Have taken those flu meds (think Nyquil), vodka, benzos like temazepam, nothing touched my insomnia. I just couldn't *fall asleep* - 100% a sleep onset problem, once I can fall asleep I'm set. 

So far, one thing has given me back my life: **Zopiclone**. Yes, I know this is not a long term solution, but my GP has given me the go ahead to take 3.75 mg a night until I get to see another sleep doc. Zopiclone is amazing. I was on the point of suicide - tired all the time, not functioning, upset. And I took it and my anxiety is gone. I can EAT again. I can fall asleep without a long struggle. I am on a low dose, but it works like magic for me after nothing worked.

1252,"Hello, sleeplessness, my old friend... ...It's not nice to stay awake with you again.

I got rid of my insomnia about about 5 weeks ago when I moved to a new continent. I threw out all my sleeping pills and benzos and Valerian and all the other crap that doesn't work. I went totally sleepless for about 50 hours while travelling, which somehow reset my insomnia clock. Then I got into this heavenly schedule of sleeping at 10pm and waking up at 5am. It was great. All I had to do was take my melatonin every night, use f.lux, and exercise every morning.

But now the insomnia is back. It started slowly...I had to start taking ZMA again, then I started lying in bed until 3am, then I stayed up all night and couldn't sleep at all. Last night I had to take 75mg of diphenhydramine HCL + 2 tramadol, along with my usual melatonin and ZMA (which is more than anyone should be taking, according to the label) to get a merciful 4 hours. Exercise is not the problem - I walked and ran 25km yesterday which I do think is more than enough. And I had woken up around 6am, so it's not like I've been sleeping all day.

So, I guess my old friend insomnia is back. I have no idea why moving across the world gave me 5 weeks of peace, but now I'm back again. Come to think of it, the last time I moved across the world, I also got 5 weeks of no insomnia. I really regret not bringing my temazepam with me because it's impossible to get a prescription for that here.

Insomnia is so bad, to the point of me sleeping for maybe an hour, then waking up at 1:00am, and just staying awake and doing my whole work day, etc.

I called my psych and now have Temazepam. It works, but I am scared to take it every night since it is a benzo, and I've had addiction problems before, and want to avoid that road.

Sometimes I sleep OK without it, but there are a ton of nights that I'll try to sleep, but wake up a little after midnight, and just can't go back to sleep. It is shitty.

1) Should I get counseling?

2) Is Temazepam addictive (or tolerance-potential) if I take it as directed every night?

This is also how it was for me.  Ambien/temazepam/lorazepam seemed to just seemed useless when my insomnia was bad, but I responded well to trazodone.  I've also heard the opposite where some insomniacs only respond to meds like ambien and benzos but trazodone made them angry or didn't help.

Does this indicate that there is actually two types of insomnia from a brain chemistry standpoint and that ADs treat one while ambien/benzos treat the other?",Temazepam
1257,"It's 6:30am and 120mg of temazepam taken at ~2am I still can't sleep. What the fuck do I do? I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I literally just laid in bed for the last 6 hours in complete darkness without opening my eyes and thinking about nothing. Before that I read and implemented advice on this sub, such as using f.lux, listening to the type of music that usually lets me sleep (tycho-dive, and the Slim-K chopped not slopped remix of Travis Scott's Rodeo). 

I usually am able to fall asleep around 2-3 off of 60mg of the temazepam (which is twice as much as I should be taking anyway, but it's the only thing that works!). It's been prescribed to me because without it I get to sleep at 4-5AM, wake up 2-4 times throughout my sleep, while sleeping have terrifying nightmares literally every night, involving things ranging from rape to murder to other generally fucked up shit. EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. And then I wake up anywhere from 3pm to 7pm. 

I'm currently prescribed 30mg of remeron a day, 300mg of Wellbutrin xl a day (And I know it has a side affect of vivid dreams, nightmares, etc. but this was occurring before  I started taking that), and 30mg of Temazepam at bedtime. 

I've already tried trazadone (hated that shit), ambien 10mg (literally did nothing), vistaril 75mg (before I started the remeron), seroquel 25-100mg (didn't work and I was uncomfortable being prescribed an antipsychotic), Benadryl 25-75mg (which is redundant due to remeron's strong histaminic activity), and extended use of melatonin in dosages I can't remember off the top of my head.

I'm afraid of what to say to my doctor, because I need something stronger and I'm worried me telling him this will cause him to think I'm a junkie or a drug dealer or something. Alongside that, I already have GAD, agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, major depressive disorder, undiagnosed PTSD, and I'm only being treated for my depression right now. I need treatment for those as well, which means more benzos, which will sound even more sketchy to him. I'm honestly at the point where I'm willing to trade benzo addiction for the freedom of anxiety and the ability to sleep. I don't want to get high, I just want to feel normal. I need him to know that, but I can't think of a way to express that to him without him thinking I'm just looking to score or get shit to sell. I mean, fuck, I'm in an entirely new city, and I'm so agoraphobic I can barely leave my room. How the hell am I gonna sell these pills (even if I wanted to) if I can't even do that?

I'm all alone here. The stress, depression and insomnia combined make me want to kill myself some days. I wouldn't, but sometimes I get the thought that it'd be better than the way I'm living right now. 

And when I went to see a psych, you know what he tried to give me? A fucking combination of pristig, wellbutrin, seroquel, and trazadone. Luckily, I convinced him to give me the remeron instead, and then he mentioned something for my anxiety too. I said fuck yes, I'd like to jump the gun and fix the anxiety while I wait for the remeron to take effect. You know what he said? ""I think we should wait to see how the remeron effects you before we add anything else, because if you take both and have an adverse reaction, we won't know which caused it."" MOTHERFUCKER YOU JUST TRIED TO TOP OFF MY DNRI WITH A SNRI (Two NRI's? Are you fucking kidding me?), A TRICYCLIC I JUST SAID I HAD A BAD REACTION TO, AND AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC THAT DID NOTHING FOR ME (his response to that was that we could try fucking Abilify instead. like, bitch, are you kidding me? I don't have bipolar disorder, I don't need a goddamn mood stabilizer!), and NOW you're worried I might have a bad reaction because of adding a single anti anxiety med? Fuck that guy.

1261,"I'm afraid to ask, but...what's next when NOTHING works? So I am new to the sub and relatively new to the whole insomnia thing. I've always been a pretty light sleeper but rarely if ever had problems staying asleep like I do now. Came out of the blue (at least that what it feels like) over the summer and I have not slept through the night once in about six months. I don't really have trouble getting to sleep...I just wake up at least once a night, usually twice, and often have a hard time getting back to bed.

I have done everything I could think to do, including:

* no screen time an hour before bed (and flux is installed on my computer for any time before that)
* cutting my already limited caffeine intake (I now drink maybe half a cup of coffee every two to three days with none after noon, a diet soda once or twice a week if that)
* all sorts of herbal/home remedies including valerian root tea, melatonin, epsom salt baths
* using a white noise machine (I live in a city)
* using a light therapy box in the mornings (seems to help a tiny bit if I'm disciplined enough to do it but I can barely pull myself out of bed in the morning and get to work in time. It's hard to make time to sit in front of a light box for an hour.)
* Shelled out money I didn't have in the first place to buy a (good) new mattress and pillows. I was REALLY bummed when this didn't help things.

I am also dealing with chronic pain of an unknown origin...which is making the need for sleep even more imperative. The nights I actually do manage to get 6 to 7 hours have me feeling a bit better. If not, I'm miserable. I've had blood tests that have come back clean (save for low vitamin D, which I am working on), urinalysis came back clean...my doctors don't know why a 30 year old feels so tired all the time and can't sleep at night. This also makes getting adequate exercise REALLY difficult (and this is coming from someone who lost 90 pounds and used to be in the gym 3-4 days a week only a few years ago)

I started seeing a therapist last year and was eventually prescribed buspar (I was really against taking meds...still am) which seemed to cut my anxiety a bit but clearly not enough. Also given Temazepam for sleep (which I only take if I am seriously desperate...even though it doesn't keep me asleep, I am able to at least get an extra hour or two of uninterrupted sleep in.)
 
After six months of getting nowhere with that therapist (frustrating), I cut out and I just started seeing a NEW therapist who specializes in insomnia...but after two visits of her giving me lists of books to read and websites to visit, I'm already starting to feel a little hopeless. I'm trying to do everything I think I am supposed to and nothing is helping. Even the meds that are supposed to help aren't helping the way I hoped they would.

1264,"Ambien vs Ambien CR I have had really bad insomnia for several years now. I've tried lots of different medications, diet changes, routine changes, exercise, valerian, melatonin, benadryl, etc. It's very difficult for me to fall asleep and once I do, it's a restless sleep and I wake up exhausted. Also, I think the maximum amount of time I've sleep is 3-4 hours at a time. And that's rare. Usually, I wake up within 45 minutes to an hour after falling asleep, which explains the waking up exhausted. I was taking Ambien for awhile but it seems to have become less effective (maybe I'm building a tolerance?) I'm on Lunesta now but it's not much help at all. If the Ambien became less effective in keeping me asleep, would Ambien CR be a better option? If I have a tolerance to Ambien, would the Ambien CR have no effect on me? Or could it be that extra layer that claims to keep you asleep like a normal human might solve the problems with Ambien slowly becoming less effective?

I don't know if that made any sense. I'm just worried because if lunesta sucks with me and ambien doesn't work like it used to, then if Ambien CR isn't an option, I'm kind of screwed. Meds like trazodone and temazepam aren't sleep medications but I've had prescribed in the past in an effort to get me some sleep...those didn't work. Clonazepam doesn't do much, either.

Trimipramine looks sedating with less likelihood of weight gain and a long half-life.  Quazepam (a benzo) isn't ideal, but it has a long half-life and is more selective for the hypnotic GABA receptors than other benzos.

I'm struggling hard.  Even if I can drug myself to sleep, I wake up 4-6 hours later and have been resorting to zolpidem (Ambien) to get 8 hours.

- Diazepam (Valium)

I'm currently trying to change my insomnia medication because my current setup is no longer working. Currently, I take Seroquel 400mg & Trazodone 300mg at bedtime. They are not traditional insomnia meds, but they can be used for that. Even doubling the doses worked for a short time, but now it no longer does.    


So I'm on some medications for my fibromyalgia (hydros, muscle relaxers & gabapentin), as well as monthly CGRP injections for my migraines (Emgality).

1282,"Need help Urgent, Severe Sleep Deprivation  Hey I recently experienced some severe sleep deprivation on top of already having a massive sleep deficit. Essentially I have insomnia from many, many complex causes.

And long story short, I have very severe ADHD, and 4 days ago I woke up later in to the day, and I stayed up while medicated (Dextro-amphetamine sulfate + transdermal nicotine \[I usually don't use nicotine\]) because I had some thing that I had to get done right then and there because of deadlines. I couldn't really fall asleep during the day due to circadian rhythm being thrown off (it's worth noting that for weeks my circadian rhythm has been fucked and it's been hell trying to fix it). The following day with no sleep I didn't take any medication or caffeine, or anything to help, which would be great if I didn't have ADHD because I somehow fall asleep better on days that I medicate. And the more sleep deprived I get, the more Hyperactive I get which in return makes me more sleep deprived. So when I didn't medicate, I still couldn't sleep because I was hyperactive and using my phone a lot, and dental pain. I'm not sure if there we're any short period where I feel asleep for like 30 minutes or not tbh.

But then onto the essentially the 3rd day of like no sleep, I didn't medicate again, but managed to injure my hip. Now this is where the fact that I have scoliosis and sciatic nerve pain become very relevant. I typically sleep on my back. Not only was I having severe dental pain, (the whole right side of my jaw would randomly start throbbing with nerve pain), but I'm not exactly sure what was wrong with my low spine, but it would essentially do some restless leg syndrome-like spasms/kicks into the air own it's own involuntarily, except they we're filled with very bad instantaneous nerve pain. And it was only in my right leg, which is the one I had messed up in a severe injury a few years ago. It's also worth noting, that I actually also have straight restless leg syndrome, which not only disrupts my sleep in it's own right, it means that OTC sleep aids like Diphenhydramine and Doxylamine Succinate (and even melatonin) are probably a very bad idea, as not only are they neurotoxic due to their anticholinergic effects but will make my restless leg syndrome force me to do unconsensual mauy thai kicks at 3 am, and due to their depressant effects I probably won't recall if I even slept or not. But I think the nerve pain and kicking, was actually due to my posture, as I had to keep repositioning my messed up spine (scoliosis) and it seemed to be somewhat related to like where my pelvis was positioned. It's worth noting that I was taking Cyclobenzaprine, 10 mgs, which could possibly make the RLS worse, but I also clench my jaw in my sleep and have a lot of muscle pain, so it's kinda hard to weigh the pros and cons. And I took maybe a total of 25 mgs throughout the entire night, because I just refused to goto sleep.

I also got out of bed for a little while a couple of times, to go on my phone and eat food, as I got hungry and can't sleep while hungry, and it's said you shouldn't just lie awake in bed for long periods. But then I had to brush my teeth which caused by jaw pain again. Towards this point, I was basically hallucinating, which would wake me up as I was about to fall asleep again, and my body would sometimes jolt as I was about to fall asleep, mind you I haven't had a stimulant in at least 40 hours at this point. It seemed like my heart rate and stuff was naturally just too high for my body to fall asleep despite not taking any stimulants and somehow my eyes weren't even remotely tired.

I ended up drinking a beer to help calm my sympathetic nervous system and my hyperactivity despite not being a huge fan of ethanol. Even then, it took like 1.5-2 hours to fall asleep and I can't even feel like I actually feel asleep. When I woke up at like 430 pm, it felt like I hadn't sleept but I'm pretty sure I feel asleep around 230-430 am, maybe 5. When I woke up I took dextro amphetamine, just because It seems I fall asleep easier on the days I medicate in contrast to not, I then a little later took a bit more than I usually despite being heavily against it, because I'm like brain dead atm, and it really seemed to have exactly no effect, and I'm afraid that If I don't wake up my body and mind a bit more so now, then when I actually try to goto sleep my mind will start racing and I won't sleep.

So my issues have been ADHD, RLS, insomnia to begin with, dental nerve pain (from like my bottom molar to my canine, and it seems idk the fluoride in my toothpaste maybe triggers it possibly for hours), nerve pain in my right sciatic nerve, neck pain (i sleep with no pillow tho), scoliosis, a really fucked up circadian rhythm, and an abysmal amount of stress and also the effects of severe sleep deprivation.

The substances I have at my disposal are Dextro-amphetamine (I've actually been able to fall asleep while medicated easily, only because I can meditate and focus on my breathing better and i'm not hyperactive, but despite even taking a higher dosage earlier, it seems to do absolutely nothing rn, and I'm dead tired and cognitive impaired, but I still doubt if I tried to sleep rn that I could), Caffeine, 7 mg Transdermal Nicotine (no tolerance really, rarely use it to improve ADHD-related cognitive dysfunction and dyslexia but only used a handful of times), Nicotine gum that I don't use at all tbh, Acetaminophen, Naproxen, Meloxicam, Cyclobenzaprine, Diphenhydramine, Doxylamine Succinate, Ramelteon, possibly cannabis (inhaled ROA, and 0 idea what chemovar), Buspirone (probably not an option, because i have fuck all idea what this drug does besides make me lightheaded, idek if its like a stimulant, sedative, or fucking both), and possibly Alcohol. I think that's it tbh, I already took only dextro-amphetamine at 5pm really only to wake up so I'd be tired when I try to sleep but it's like I didn't even take it tbh, and my ADHD makes me hyperactive when I try to sleep, so Idk if i should try to use it to sleep or not take it at all.

The reason I can't go to my doctor is because well A. It's sunday, B. Idk when I could get an appointment. C. I have ADHD and doctors don't like prescribing sedatives because some cause paradoxical adverse reactions, and other doctors are against prescribing a sedative if you take a stimulant, even for short-term use \[which is probably the only use for a sedative drug tbh\].

So does anyone have the best course of action here, because I'm at a fucking loss as to what I should do. If it's not one thing, it's another like I forgot to eat and then I can't sleep because I'm hungry, or I'm having nerve pain which is essentially impossible to sleep with or at least for me it is. I'm trying to do things correctly, but it really seems like a dilemma where there's no good options and even when it seems I did everything to the best of my ability, then it just seems my body refuses to sleep for fuck all reasoning, or a reason I can't figure, and probably because I'm so god damn sleep deprived.

So please, if anyone has experience or expertise in or any fucking input at all. please advise me what to do potentially, do keep in mind there's like a 1,000 fucking variables at play. Thank you for at least reading this!",Ramelteon
1283,"My Experience with Trazodone and Where to go From Here Hello all, 

Long time insomniac. To give you a short run-down, I've had trouble sleeping all my life. Natural night-owl, find it impossible to go to sleep early unless I absolutely wreck my sleep schedule and suffer for a day or 2. Have been taking adderall and Vyvanse for ADHD that went untreated for years. Been on these for the last 3 years, which have honestly made my insomnia worse, but they are a necessity for me in medical school now. 

I started taking trazodone about 6 weeks ago. Real fast I realized that this drug was PERFECT for me. Not too sedating, but just enough to get me to sleep. For the first time in a decade, I slept through the night without issues. I was waking up with more energy, my adderall and vyvanse felt like they were twice as effective, and my anxiety was at an all-time low. It felt like my life was taking a 180 because of trazodone. 

After two weeks, things started getting a little different. The orthostatic hypotension wasn't too bad, but it started getting borderline dangerous at times. This kinda went away. But that new focus I had found slowly started to dissipate. I went from feeling amazing to feeling groggy all day long. It felt like my adderall and vyvanse weren't working anymore. I went from being super energized every morning to taking 2-3 hours just to reach what I would call a sub-optimal level of functionality. I started throwing some caffeine in every now and then, but now even that is ineffective. The weirdest part - auditory hallucinations. Now I've consistently been getting 8 hours of sleep. So I know I'm not in some sort of stimulant-induced psychosis. Over the last 4 weeks, it has happened maybe 2-3 times. Just hearing noises that I knew weren't there. 

This last week, things have gotten bad. Total brain fog all day long. This weird, vague headache when I've never had headaches my entire life. It feels like my libido is totally gone. Intense feelings of depersonalization/derealization. At times I feel depressed. Most of the time I just feel numb. Barely feels like my adderall or vyvanse are working at all. I recently upped my dose too after being on the same dose for 2 years in preparation for a big exam. I've been taking all sorts of  vitamins for brain health. With the addition of good sleep, I doubt I'm hitting some sort of stimulant tolerance. What has really scared me though are the auditory hallucinations. They used to only occur at night, but for the past two days, they've occurred during the day. Hearing someone knocking on the front door, only to see no one there. Hearing the refrigerator water dispenser activating, going out of my room to talk to my roommate and realizing no one is home. And this morning this feeling of a lump in my throat that is borderline painful.

 I am still grounded in reality, but I am worried. My big exam is in a week and I've wondered if I should just quit the trazodone cold turkey. I noticed my symptoms were worse on an increased dose, so I'm almost certain its the trazodone. I plan on asking my doc for a 7 day course of ambien just to hold me over until my test, as he has done that in the past and its been effective. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I am really worried.

1288,"You don’t need to be on narcotics Before you downvote, hear me out. I’m a long time user of drugs, and i have severe insomnia. I go weeks or months at a time getting 2-3 hours of sleep per night if i’m lucky. I often have to choose between sobriety and sleep. I want you to know some important information. Anticholinergic medications like trazodone, unisom/doxylamine, or benadryl/DPH, as well as GABAergic medications like ambien or benzos, reduce quality of sleep. They’re also both [linked to dementia and cognitive decline](https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/two-types-of-drugs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-the-sake-of-your-brain) when used long-term. Serotonergic medications like TCI’s also cause severe withdrawal. People are often not educated on these dangers by doctors.

You REALLY don’t want to be addicted to GABAergic medications. It WILL happen if you take them as prescribed. Quitting will not only make your insomnia worse, but it also causes seizures. I have a friend who took benzos and developed epilepsy because it pushed his brain’s balance of inhibitory neurotransmitters into a critical state of deficiency. Most people who take benzos take them for life. But there’s good news, you have other options.

I was watching a podcast with an expert on these topics called Hamilton Morris. I’m going to paraphrase what he said; “Chemists DO make non-addictive/non-narcotic medications but they’re usually unsuccessful commercially because people don’t continue taking them. For example, people with ADHD who are prescribed strattera usually don’t continue taking it for long, because it’s not enjoyable and it’s not going to make you eager to take it again.” He then mentioned insomnia medications. He said there are non-addictive sleep medications which aren’t frequently prescribed. The examples he gave were belsomra and ramelteon.

Belsomra is an orexin receptor antagonist. It seems to be rather successful, but some people get side effects, so make sure to look into those to make an educated decision on whether or not this medication is right for you.

Ramelteon is the one which interested me the most. It’s a melatonin receptor agonist that’s 10x as strong as melatonin at the receptor site. Given it’s mechanism, it has an extremely low rate of side effects (only 1% in clinical trials) and it has a fairly high success rate.

Both of these medications are non-addictive. To my knowledge, neither cause cognitive decline or dementia. I’m not sure about belsomra and quality of sleep, but ramelteon most likely increases sleep quality based on the way it works. To be honest, it disgusts me that doctors prescribe xanax and ambien so frequently, they should be an absolute last resort. They are highly capable of permanently ruining your life.",Ramelteon
1289,"Anything that can help with sleep long term with no weight gain ? I'm taking 70mg tranylcypromine in the morning for depression, and cannot sleep without a sleep aid.

I used to take quetiapine. That wasn't really working for sleep, and made me gain about 15kg on top of that.

I switched to 60mg mianserin, which is better but not optimal. I noticed a augmentation of the antidepressant effect though. I'm finally in full remisiion after years of suffering so I don't want to change anything related to mood for the time being.

My problems are:

* I can't lose the weight I gained on quetiapine, and I still have the munchies at night after I take my mianserin;
* My sleep is highly chaotic, I can sleep 3 hours one night and 13 hours another.

I need something that:

*  can counteract mianserin's effects on appetite/metabolism, or help with weight loss in another way, or at least something that wouldn't make the situation worse;
* helps stablilizing my sleep;
* I can take continuously long term, or things I could cycle.

At the moment I'm using melatonin, Mg L-threonate, lemon balm, eschscholzia, valerian, ashwaganhda as well as 20mg alimemazine on top of mianserin, and zopiclone when it's not enough.

I thought of topiramate and zonisamide, but I'm not too comfortable taking something that can lead to physical addiction and withdrawals. Maybe I could cycle them with something else ? I'm not too sure about ramelteon's effectiveness for either sleep or weight loss. Suvorexant isn't available in my country.

The only problem is I've put on weight (40 lbs) from it and my cholesterol and triglycerides are through the roof and I now have fatty liver. I've tried to lower my lipids with a low carb diet and taking lots of niacin and niacinaminde. They're improved but still high (triglycerides down from the 400's to the 200's).

1294,"Feedback: Ambien/Stilnox vs Belsomra Hi,

I'm posting my feedback about these two ""Z drugs"" (namely zolpidem vs suvorexant).  In my country these are marketed as Stilnox and Belsomra respectively.

My feedback is:

1. Stilnox (Ambien) is much better than Belsomra;
2. Belsomra consistently created very disturbing vivid nightmares, that leave you shaken in the morning.  This did not happen with Stilnox.

Also XR is much better in both cases (no waking up during the night, like what happened with IR).",Suvorexant
1295,"Amitriptyline 10mg - needing advice Hi all,

Doctor told me to start on amitriptyline 10mg yesterday. 

At least once a week (if not a couple nights) I’ll be up till about 8 or 9am with symptoms of hyper arousal. Suvorexant works sometimes but leaves me absolutely zombified the next day, and 5mg Valium does not work if I take it when I’m in the thick of things.

I took 10mg amitriptyline last night and it worked a charm (and gave me strangely vivid dreams - which I don’t really mind because at least it feels like I got a deeper sleep) However I have a couple concerns: 
1. Has anyone experienced weight gain at this dose? It’s a huge fear of mine
2. Do I need to take this every night (I.e, does it build up in your system like an anti depressant would or is this not necessary - I’ve read conflicting advice) 
3. If I miss a dose, will I have withdrawal symptoms?

Thank you!",Suvorexant
1296,"My Experience with Trazodone and Where to go From Here Hello all, 

Long time insomniac. To give you a short run-down, I've had trouble sleeping all my life. Natural night-owl, find it impossible to go to sleep early unless I absolutely wreck my sleep schedule and suffer for a day or 2. Have been taking adderall and Vyvanse for ADHD that went untreated for years. Been on these for the last 3 years, which have honestly made my insomnia worse, but they are a necessity for me in medical school now. 

I started taking trazodone about 6 weeks ago. Real fast I realized that this drug was PERFECT for me. Not too sedating, but just enough to get me to sleep. For the first time in a decade, I slept through the night without issues. I was waking up with more energy, my adderall and vyvanse felt like they were twice as effective, and my anxiety was at an all-time low. It felt like my life was taking a 180 because of trazodone. 

After two weeks, things started getting a little different. The orthostatic hypotension wasn't too bad, but it started getting borderline dangerous at times. This kinda went away. But that new focus I had found slowly started to dissipate. I went from feeling amazing to feeling groggy all day long. It felt like my adderall and vyvanse weren't working anymore. I went from being super energized every morning to taking 2-3 hours just to reach what I would call a sub-optimal level of functionality. I started throwing some caffeine in every now and then, but now even that is ineffective. The weirdest part - auditory hallucinations. Now I've consistently been getting 8 hours of sleep. So I know I'm not in some sort of stimulant-induced psychosis. Over the last 4 weeks, it has happened maybe 2-3 times. Just hearing noises that I knew weren't there. 

This last week, things have gotten bad. Total brain fog all day long. This weird, vague headache when I've never had headaches my entire life. It feels like my libido is totally gone. Intense feelings of depersonalization/derealization. At times I feel depressed. Most of the time I just feel numb. Barely feels like my adderall or vyvanse are working at all. I recently upped my dose too after being on the same dose for 2 years in preparation for a big exam. I've been taking all sorts of  vitamins for brain health. With the addition of good sleep, I doubt I'm hitting some sort of stimulant tolerance. What has really scared me though are the auditory hallucinations. They used to only occur at night, but for the past two days, they've occurred during the day. Hearing someone knocking on the front door, only to see no one there. Hearing the refrigerator water dispenser activating, going out of my room to talk to my roommate and realizing no one is home. And this morning this feeling of a lump in my throat that is borderline painful.

 I am still grounded in reality, but I am worried. My big exam is in a week and I've wondered if I should just quit the trazodone cold turkey. I noticed my symptoms were worse on an increased dose, so I'm almost certain its the trazodone. I plan on asking my doc for a 7 day course of ambien just to hold me over until my test, as he has done that in the past and its been effective. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I am really worried. 

What are my options now for sustainable sleep medications? Ramelteon? Suvorexant? Honestly, being sleep deprived is 10X better than the way I feel now.",Suvorexant
1297,"Has anyone tried Belsomra/Suvorexant? This is the next med my doctor wants me to try, I understand it's a ""newer"" insomnia med, and I've tried pretty much everything else,  but I'd love to hear yalls experiences with it!",Suvorexant
1298,"Just need to vent I’m 22 years old and have struggled with sleep since I was 14. Sleeping at night has always been the biggest struggle, I can generally sleep okay during the day with meds but it’s just impossible at night. I also very very rarely get the actual feeling of being tired/sleepy but definitely get physical and emotional effects of not sleeping.

At the end of last year I was finally referred to a Sleep Psychologist and put on Suvorexant and Melatonin which did absolutely nothing for me so Promethazine was then added to the mix too. I was told it would probably take a while to start working and was also put on a strict routine.. Still nothing. Got told I needed to see a Psychiatrist before the Sleep Psychologist would prescribe me anything else. 

Went to the Psychiatrist and she hated the fact that I was on three different meds for sleeping so she prescribed me 25mg of Seroquel. That worked for like three days then stopped so my dosage was upped to 50mg and that lasted about a week so it was upped again to 75mg. She won’t up it anymore because she says its then being taken as an antipsychotic rather than sleep aid. I’m also on some other meds for a bunch of undiagnosed things (my psychiatrist doesn’t want to label anything)(Lithium, Zoloft, Diazepam). 

The 75mg isn’t working anymore and I’m so done with it all. Not being able to do something as simple as sleeping is so disheartening and makes me feel like I’m messed up in some horrible way. I also cannot even drink caffeine because one coffee will cause me to have tremors for a week after I’ve drunk it. 

It all feels like something thats never gonna end or get better, a never ending battle with my own body and with different doctors etc. It’s also so draining financially seeing so many people for something that nobody can seem to fix. 

If you got this far thanks for listening to my 5am rant. I have to be up at 7am to take care of a child. Honestly can’t keep doing this, it’s putting me and everyone around me in some form of risky situation.",Suvorexant
1299,"Anything that can help with sleep long term with no weight gain ? I'm taking 70mg tranylcypromine in the morning for depression, and cannot sleep without a sleep aid.

I used to take quetiapine. That wasn't really working for sleep, and made me gain about 15kg on top of that.

I switched to 60mg mianserin, which is better but not optimal. I noticed a augmentation of the antidepressant effect though. I'm finally in full remisiion after years of suffering so I don't want to change anything related to mood for the time being.

My problems are:

* I can't lose the weight I gained on quetiapine, and I still have the munchies at night after I take my mianserin;
* My sleep is highly chaotic, I can sleep 3 hours one night and 13 hours another.

I need something that:

*  can counteract mianserin's effects on appetite/metabolism, or help with weight loss in another way, or at least something that wouldn't make the situation worse;
* helps stablilizing my sleep;
* I can take continuously long term, or things I could cycle.

At the moment I'm using melatonin, Mg L-threonate, lemon balm, eschscholzia, valerian, ashwaganhda as well as 20mg alimemazine on top of mianserin, and zopiclone when it's not enough.

I thought of topiramate and zonisamide, but I'm not too comfortable taking something that can lead to physical addiction and withdrawals. Maybe I could cycle them with something else ? I'm not too sure about ramelteon's effectiveness for either sleep or weight loss. Suvorexant isn't available in my country. CBD has only weak proofs for sleep and is too expansive at the dose they use in the papers, on top of having an interaction with mianserin through CYP2D6, so not a realist option.",Suvorexant
1300,"One month of sleep problems and other things In the last month my sleep problems (minor of about 6 years which then became more major last year but still manageable with suvorexant and zopiclone) have become a real problem as I'm on clonazepam as well as CBT-I (for 3 weeks now) but still have fluctuations in my sleep. I've gotten some okay nights in the last 4 days 2/4 days I slept 7 but I lay in bed longer than I was supposed to and other various small things. 

&#x200B;

Today I'm feeling awful despite the fact that I should've slept soundly for 5 hours 56 minutes so I'm really beginning to wonder if it's just insomnia and honestly i have a nagging thought in my head of having a prion disease (not even necessarily sFI but also sCJD)  though I manage to dispel it, it never fully goes away and especially on days like this it comes back at it's worst. 

&#x200B;

Though I really wonder if it could be something else as I've been to a sleep physician and he diagnosed me with health anxiety but despite what I said above I feel that overall I've reduce it but maybe not...? I'm getting a COR2 (Cortisol) and thyroid blood test done soon.

Imovane (Zopiclone): 7/10. Very effective and no hangover effects. But also extremely addictive and tolerance develops quickly. Persistent bad taste in mouth the next day is a horrible side effect too.

Benadryl (diphenhydramine): 6/10. Reasonably effective and cheap. Dry mouth side effects and hard to get in my country.

Phenergan (Promethazine): 7/10. More effective than Benadryl and better for anxiety as well. OTC in my country. Relatively cheap.

Temazepam: 7/10. Cheap and effective. Same as Imovane but cheaper in my country and no taste disturbances. Also addictive and tolerance develops quickly.

Elavil (Amitriptyline): 5/10. Very cheap but doesn’t always put me to sleep. Lots of side effects especially with long term use.

Remeron (Mirtazapine): 9/10. Has always been effective for me and is very cheap. Increased appetite and weight gain with long term use and can make you sleep 10+ hours. Didn’t give it a full 10/10 due to side effects.

1302,"Finally am able to have a good nights sleep with a fairly new med, Belsomra(suvorexant). I struggled pretty hardcore sleeping for a very long time, went through the same ringer of sleeping meds and CBT practices as I am sure a lot of you nightowls have, and landed on ambien for quite a while. It would but me to sleep as long as I didnt take it too many nights in a row but I never would feel well rested during the day. After a couple years of on and off use I started to try and fix my insomnia again, and saw a new doctor. She prescribed me with Belsomra about a month ago. The first night was not perfect but almost every night after that I have been asleep by midnight. 
 
To people who have been stuck as insomniacs for prolonged periods of time, a month of good sleep feels so. so. so. good. I am actually a completely different person than I was before. It is a little expensive as most insurance does not fully cover it but it could be worth giving a shot.

Trying to cut back on MT, I lowered my dose from 20mg to 15mg and added 500mg of Magnesium.  Magnesium has made me sleep soundly before.

Now I can't sleep and I feel ... something like how I feel if I drink too much port wine.

Apparently this is a muscle relaxant now.

Well shit.  I feel pretty good but this is not what I was going for.  I obviously need to talk with my psychiatrist; I have no idea how a metal ion could interact with a GABA receptor positive allosteric modulator like this (granted, the drug itself works by increasing the Cl- ions passing into the neuron--not the point).

I worked in Big Pharma for 17 years so I know Adverse Reactions are played down as much as possible so PLEASE consider the following info before taking this new drug.

When I first read about it in 2013, the claim was it caused no next day drowsiness. I thought that would be a huge advantage so I bought Merck.
Then, before it went to market the FDA told them to reduce the recommended initial dosage because what Merck was proposing caused nest day drowsiness.
""The agency concluded that safety data presented by Merck did not support approval of the drug, called suvorexant, in 30- and 40-milligram doses, the company said Monday, and recommended that most patients start on a 10-milligram dose, which the company had not proposed selling. Two higher doses, at 15 and 20 milligrams, could be used in patients for whom the 10-milligram dose didn’t work, Merck said.""
Then in August of 2014 I saw this on Bllomberg: ""Side effects of the drug include sleep-driving and other complex behaviors while not fully awake, such as preparing and eating food, making phone calls, or having sex, the FDA said.""
So, no different than Ambien.
From the Merck: ""The effect of BELSOMRA on respiratory function should be considered.
Sleep paralysis, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and cataplexy-like symptoms can occur. The risk of cataplexy-like symptoms increases with the dose of BELSOMRA.""
And:""In clinical studies, a dose-dependent increase in suicidal ideation was observed in patients taking Belsomra as assessed by questionnaire. Immediately evaluate patients with suicidal ideation or any new behavioral sign or symptom.""",Suvorexant

1311,"My short term “cure” for insomnia (long post) I had a trauma occur and have had insomnia for almost year. I know that insomnia has to be up there with the worst mental conditions. 

I had a bout of insomnia with no REM and no deep sleep for a month, I felt awake the whole time and it was the worst experience of my life. I felt like my natural ability to sleep was broken and circadian rhythm was damaged beyond repair. How did I eventually get sleep? (Besides micro sleep) Along with some other things I’ll mention, I finally found a medication combo that worked which is Mirtazapine (Remeron), Temazepam/Klonopin, Melatonin, a little weed (2 hours before bedtime) and a high dose of quality CBD. Now I take tolerance breaks from these meds and my sleep is a little shaky but the meds I use on my T break is Trazodone, CBD, Weed and Magnolia Bark. I’m hoping therapy will help me ween off the meds and switch to only natural remedies. We know the risk potential with Benzos so use them only when you absolutely need them, and if you get to that point, the pros outweigh the cons. But still don’t take them daily for long periods of time.

Retraining your circadian rhythm is a big factor if you’ve gone weeks without sleep. If your circadian rhythm was so out of wack like mine I suggest you get sunlight in the morning whenever you “wake up” and caffeine early in the morning, obviously not near bed time. It tells your body this is when you should wake up. Now before you lay down to go to sleep at night, stay up as long as you possibly can before your body starts to give in, aka sleep restriction therapy, and then add in the medication. Make sure your occupying your time with fun and mellow activities during this time and minimal blue light. If you suffer from OCD tendencies or negative thought patterns I highly recommend and OTC supplement NAC to take in the daytime. One of the biggest keys is to make sure to supplement with Creatine, Vitamin BCD, Fish Oil, Magnesium, Zinc, Fiber and a TON of water as your body gets depleted of these quicker during long bouts of insomnia especially Vit B, creatine and water. Try to be as healthy as possible to counteract the negative health effects from insomnia, exercise is crutial but don’t over do it. Get really nice earplugs and therapy can really help as well. A lot of people don’t understand insomnia so having a therapist to vent about it to is helpful.

I believe 98% of peoples insomnia stems from some form of trauma in their life, or just gradually built up depression, or both. One of the most important thing I mention is to remind yourself that your insomnia is caused by the trauma and is a normal reaction to it. No need to put blame on yourself, some things are out of our control. 

Other meds I’ve tried-

Seroquel- This is a god send for some and definitely makes you tired but it’s feel weird type of tired that keeps me up. 

Trazodone- Not terrible, it works sometimes but not when anxiety is high. 

Hydroxyzine- Worked a few times then stopped.

Ambien- Works when paired with benzo be careful with doses.

Magnesium/Melatonin/CBD/Theanine- Hopefully I’ll get to a point where these are all I need but not currently.

Phenibut/Gabapentin- GABA-B antagonists give me sort of energizing feel so didn’t work well the few times I tried it. Don’t use daily.

Kratom- Really good natural remedy for depression. Don’t use daily.

I want to try Magnolia Bark and Oleamide, I hear work well. I also need a consistent meditation routine.

1313,"[Update] How my sleep is nowadays My insomniac phase is far from over but it has significantly reduced and improved over the last few months. This may be my last r/insomnia post as I begin to move on and turn my back from insomnia. 

So basically my insomnia started June last year and like any typical newly insomniac, I had sleep anxiety and dived into a cocktail of meds. My worst time was a series of 2-4days of no sleep. In July, my case changed to some kind of sleep maintenance were I would wake up 3-6x a night and there are some blocks of me being awake (30-1.5hr in between). I also tried a lot of things like sleep hygiene, sleep restriction and cbti. The anxiety was there and I was always thinking of sleep every single day and how I am going to survive the night.

Things started to improve in September and I stopped my meds and  only had melatonin and diphenhydramine for emergency cases.  They were meant for days where it’s over midnight and I havent been able to sleep.

December was really the game changer for me. My last bad night was Dec 2. Dec 3 to present, I am a almost back to my sleep pattern before and I have not had a single melatonin since then. I still wake up once or twice a night but compared before where I wake up ever 1-3hrs, I can now stretch it to 5-7hrs before waking up. I always get a total of 7.5-9hrs of sleep every day and my wake up times are always brief, like seconds to a few minutes. My sleep time is typically between 8-9:30PM and I am awake by 5-6AM. I have also experienced sleeping between 10PM-1AM and my sleep quality is still great.

I got rid of all the strict sleep hygienes that I usually do and stopped worrying about sleeping. The sleep anxiety is gone and I went back to my old self before insomnia. The only thing that I have is sleep mask which has been a great help to me every night. 

I know every insomniac is different so my case is definitely not too extreme but it was debilitating and frustrating just the same.

Last night, I went to bed a little late than usual at 10PM, woke up around 2:58AM when I checked the time, I went back to sleep in minutes and woke up around 5:52AM. I feel refreshed and ready to function through the day.

His doctor put him on Benadryl, 2 a night, he upped that to 4 at night and 6 melatonin. Still shit sleep. Or tossing and turning. Or laying there awake. 

Now he’s on Temazepam, for the first time last night. It took 2 hours to hit and still shit sleep. Tossing, turning, laying awake then hella drowsy unable to function in the morning. 

In the time span that we’ve been together I’ve only seen him sleep one night, and that was the night after I took him with me to rock climb. His body was exhausted and he slept the entire night.

Insomnia is truly ruining my life… I have constant stress, anxiety and migraines due to lack of sleep which is causing me serious depression.

1320,"self treating with weed pen ive had insomnia my whole life- extreme difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep due to non stop thoughts and thinking. melatonin has never worked. ive been smoking a weed pen for the past 3 years every night to sleep and it works but im worried about the long term effects of smoking a cart because i know theres chemicals and stuff (i always buy carts from dispensaries so at least they’re regulated). i figure it’s probably better than any big pharma drug that could be prescribed to me but i really dont know what to do bc ik its not healthy but ive tried natural teas, and natural remedies and melatonin and meditation but nothing works. any suggestions??

1321,"get up or nah? So I struggle with sleep and my doctor has prescribed me melatonin. I've been working on fixing my circadian rhythm for around 7 months now. If I randomly wake up at 5 am knowing I haven't gotten enough hours of sleep, should I force myself to get back to bed or will that result to sleep inertia?

I took 1 2mg tablet last night. 2 hours later I had to take 300 mcg of regular melatonin. and only slept 3 hours. I usually take Pure Zzzs ER (2mg melatonin and herbals), 

Has anyone had good sleep with Remfresh? What dose? Bottle says take 1 or 2. Do I need to go to 4mg ? I haven't taken that much before, but I will if that's what it takes.

1323,"Long term effects of Ambien? I'll try to cut the story short. I've been a bad sleeper ever since I was a child, but never  used stronger medicine (only magnesium, melatonin, valerian, all types of relaxation techniques) or see a doctor until last year, when I slept 1-2 hours for a week, and 2 days with complete sleep deprivation. 

So I went to see a doctor in a totally devastated state, I could barely talk, while shaking like hell. So I got prescribed ambien and other medicine for anxiety. After taking 10 mg of ambien I fall asleep and slept for 12 hours.
I continued with the medication for anxiety for 3 months, but I got back to my normal sleeping routine without taking any more Ambien.

Everything was"" fine"" for almost 8 months, but in November I couldn't sleep for 2 days again, and the PTSD from last time when I was in this state hit me.  So I took Ambien again, for 2 days, and then I didnt needed it anymore to fall asleep.

And this happened again last month, except I had to take it for 7 days in a smaller dose(only taking it after trying to sleep for hours). And now it happened again, and I'm getting pretty scared of the side effects and addiction. I already feel some side effects  in the daytime, my heart randomly starts beating fast, sweating (panic-like state).

So I'm curious about experiences with this medicine? (+ I have an appointment tomorrow with a doctor)",Melatonin
1324,"Migraines and ambien Interesting observation I had; figured I’d share. 

I’m a 39F who has had insomnia since I was a child. I’ve been on ambien for many years. I also get periodic “silent migraines” which are basically where I have crazy ambien-resistant insomnia for a night or two, followed by feeling like I’m going to cry (both would be considered “prodrome” I believe), followed by hours of intense nausea, crawly sensations on my scalp, and sweatiness (I think this is the actual “silent migraine” part of the equation). When I was pregnant, I used to get near daily “ocular migraines” where I’d get a weird zigzag spot in my vision on one side, and it would take about an hour to work its way across my field of vision to the other side and eventually go away. Didn’t get nausea back then, just the visuals. Now I don’t get the visuals, but I do get the major nausea and it lasts all day. 

Anyway, what I just realized is that those 1-2 nights prior to a migraine, my ambien doesn’t work, like AT ALL. I end up taking multiple repeat doses over a few hours trying to make it do its thing, and at best end up with a couple hours of “twilight sleep” where I’m conscious but half-asleep. Sucks. Worst of all, I end up wasting about 1/4 of my month’s supply of ambien on those nights, and then am stuck not having it at all for the last week of the month. 

The good news is I finally made the connection. The bad news is I yet again will be 7 days short on medication this month :( Wish it weren’t a controlled medication anymore, because I truly can’t functionally sleep at all without it, and as a busy mom of 2, I can’t afford that week of sleeplessness.

Fwiw, I also take unisom (doxylamine), melatonin, magnesium, and Benadryl (diphenhydramine) on a nightly basis along with the ambien. Sometimes far in excess of what’s recommended, but my insomnia is nuts, and they’re relatively safe medications.

Hope this helps someone else out there. ❤️",Melatonin

One thing i’ve noticed is my motivation to turn my life around, lose weight, go back to college, start a business or take care of myself kicks in around 2am every night. 

I’ll get this sudden urge to do so much. I plan to workout in the morning, eat healthier, start a project. Anything. I’ll just plan to do anything. Then I spend the next couple hours studying how I can do it tomorrow. I envision myself succeeding, but then when morning hits I have *no motivation at ALL*

I lose it all. I sleep till the late hours, I miss breakfast and lunch. I miss engaging with friends and family. I miss out on so much. So why is it i’m only motivated in my life to do so much at such late hours? I feel this is the real reason I can’t sleep at night. I’ve tried Melatonin before. It sometimes work.

1327,"Hydroxyzine, melatonin, Seroquel, CBTI, and my sleep! Hi, all! I've been a bad sleeper for a long time. On nights where I fall asleep at a normal (for my wakeup time), I tend to wake up after 5 or 6 hours and not be able to go back to sleep. Some nights I can't fall asleep for hours, or not at all. I have a later ideal sleep pattern (2am - 11am would likely be my body's ideal sleep schedule), but I work an 8am - 5pm so that's not possible. Also worth nothing that I was an alcoholic from about 2010 to 2019, so I'd drink until I'd knock out each night, but usually my sleep would be really restless. 

Since getting sober, my sleep issues have gotten worse. There will be weeks at a time where I'm unable to sleep more than 5 hours a night, and during this weeks, at least once a week I won't be able to sleep at all. For the past 7 days, I've had 3 no-sleep days, and very recently had 2 solid weeks of 5 hours of sleep per night or less. I've been through a CBTI program, so if I feel like I've been laying in bed for a while trying to sleep (I don't have any clocks in my room), I get up and read or watch tv until I feel sleepy again. I also have an interactive sleep app that usually knocks me out (I use it with blue light blocking glasses), but on no-sleep nights I'll do the whole sequence on it, try to sleep for a while, do the sequence again, try to sleep again, and then just end up getting up. 

I've tried melatonin, and while it definitely made me sleepy, it was even harder for me to actually fall asleep. Same with edibles. I tried Seroquel ER 50mg, which made me fall asleep but it took a while, and I felt horrible when I woke up. Recently, my doctor put me on hydroxyzine 100mg, which knocked me right out last night when I took it at 11pm (first time trying it), but I slept through my 7:30am alarm and woke up at 9:15am still feeling like I could sleep a year. Even after coffee, this sleepy, groggy feeling didn't go away until the late afternoon/early evening, and I really felt like I couldn't function without a nap for a bit around 2-3pm.

Although I do all she asks me to do. Take my melatonin three hours before bedtime, put my phone away two to three hours before bedtime, do something quiet to clear my mind. It doesn’t work. I am still lying in my bed from midnight to god knows what time.

1329,"How I Helped My Insomnia - Induced by Anxiety/Depression Hello, all! So, first, I'm going to start out with background information/context.

I'm a 22M and I began a bout of insomnia around November 12, 2021. Within less than two weeks, I turned to Indica joints, CBD oil, CBD capsules, CBD/THC strains, melatonin, ZZZquill, and nothing was really helping. I was getting, on average 2-4 hours of sleep a night, but I would often lay awake in bed for 5 hours in between.

Then, I went to my doctor who prescribed me 7.5mg Zopiclone to help me sleep. Zopiclone is intended to help you get to sleep, and stay asleep. One week on Zopiclone, my best sleep was about 6 hours, but I still woke up. Other than that, it was still 4-5 hour sleeps.

Then my doctor prescribed me 25mg of Quetiapine, but she told me to only take half. She said that this low dose could be used for sleep, but that wasn't the medication's primary use. I slept 6 hours on this Quetiapine, but I had an awful reaction. I felt groggy/high for 12 hours, and I did not feel like myself, nor did I feel like I had control of my body. (I took it at 1am, and didn't feel good until 1pm). I only took it once, then threw them out.

After that, my sleeps were getting worse. I was getting maybe 2-3 hours of deep sleep per night, if that. My sleep anxiety had deeply worsened, and every morning I would finally summon the power to get out of bed and immediately start thinking and obsessing about the night to come. Nightime had become my worst enemy, and I was scared.

Then after some more reflection, I went to my doctor and she prescribed me Sertraline to help with the anxiety and depression that my insomnia was causing me (Though in retrospect, I know I suffered from it beforehand as well).

Here we are, almost 7 weeks after I started Sertraline, and I'm seeing 7-8 hour sleeps again. But it's not just the Sertraline that has helped me get to this point. I put in a lot of work myself, and I wanted to share some tips and whatnot.

**What Caused my Insomnia?** Well, I don't know for sure, but I have some guesses.

\-I live in Canada, and the winter months (October - March/April) have always induced symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder.

\-I had to let go of two really close friends of mine due to the relationships being toxic, and I was inadvertently grieving those losses.

\-I believe I was finally feeling the effects of the pandemic (being couped up at home all day, not going out, online school).

**What Helped My Insomnia?**

\-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and therapy in general: Getting to talk to people other than my immediate friends and family, and receiving tips from C.B.T. such as keeping an anxiety log, and journaling.

\-Exercise: 30 minutes of exercise a day and getting my body up and moving after being too depressed to do anything has done wonders. I know this won't be easy for everybody, but trust me, if you can, I highly recommend it.

\-Sleep Schedule: Try to stick to the same sleep schedule as best as you can. I'm going to bed around 12AM and sleeping until 7/7:30 AM.

\-Night Time Routine: I know that sleep hygiene tips don't work for everybody. But introducing a night time routine has helped me immensely. I take a shower in the evening, add lavender essential oil to my wrists, feet, and temples, and then put socks on. Usually, I watch television or a movie until about 11PM, and then from 11 to 12, I read. The reading tires me out, and I'm not staring at a screen. I also try to be off my phone by 10 at the latest.

\-Journaling. I thought it was stupid at first, but honestly, journaling is therapeutic. Dump out any and all feelings onto the paper. Whether it's about how you're feeling inside, or whether it's a random thought you're having. I often find myself going back to my entries from November and seeing how far I've come puts a smile on my face.

\-Melatonin/Magnesium: I recommend Jamieson brand of the 5mg melatonin/150mg magnesium duo. It works wonders. Magnesium has several benefits for helping with anxiety/depression, and the melatonin makes you tired. I recommend only taking them on really bad nights.

\-Valerian Root Capsules: Valerian root is a natural sedative. These helped less than the M/M, but I still found they worked! Again, only take when needed.

\-Sertraline. If you suspect your insomnia is a reaction to depression or anxiety, or if your insomnia is causing you depression or anxiety, talk to your doctor about maybe getting put on anti-depression or anti-anxiety medication.

Insomnia comes and goes in waves for many people. And I know that there are many reasons as to why people fall ill with insomnia. I'm lucky enough that mine seemed to be from depression/anxiety/stress and that it has seemingly gotten better, but I know not everyone is that lucky. To this day, I still wake up some days and get a little anxious over whether or not I will sleep. I've had at least 3 semi-bad nights (5 hour sleeps, laying there awake) since my sleeping has improved but the key is not to dwell. If you let one bad night get to you, that night will turn into more bad nights.

I wish you all the best, and I wish you all great sleeps.",Melatonin
1330,"Sleep medicine As some of y’all know from my posts my sleep doctor put me on klonopin .5-1mg daily every night. As I said I’m weary of taking it. I’ve heard of the dangers of benzo withdrawal and dependence 

I bought rso cannabis Sat night at the dispensary and Vaped northern lights. I fell asleep sunday night and even though I hate using the cpap mask I had it on all night. 

Decided to take a break Monday night and used simply sleep which is just an expensive Benadryl and melatonin. I tried using my cpap machine and felt so congested but I did not feel that way when I used the rso. I actually have a new mask coming in the mail since the one I have is old so maybe that will help.

Also have a pending at home sleep study test that may change my settings on the machine or I might need a whole new one . 


Now here’s the thing I don’t want to gain any tolerance to the cannabis so I thought maybe take it 3 days during the week and 2 days off with something else. Any suggestions? I’m also seeing a nurse practitioner this week that works on mental health but not sure if I want to take any more meds 

I’ve been doing sleep hygiene before bed but last night it was absolutely terrible . Like I feel so tired compared to Monday where I felt energy . I actually called off today and using it as a mental health day . I actually believe some people should be able to file for disability for chronic insomnia 

I know sleep hygiene is the golden standard here but I think some of us have a chemical imbalance where we also need meds. I’ve had people tell me just try a melatonin , sleepytime tea or drink milk. It does not help my chronic insomnia . I know some people try to help but it’s just nerve racking sometimes

It's been a few weeks since my insomia began; I didn't sleep for an entire night so I kept obsessing over how that might continue and anxiety kept building up. Which means that I didn't sleep well, if at all, the following days. Now sleep anxiety has completely consumed my thoughts. Almost every waking moment is focused on that. It's been over 2 days since I last slept and my arms/legs feel extremely tired and my mind feels foggy. I know that SOMETIME I'll fall asleep, but I can't do this for much longer. My mind races ceaselessly and my heart pounds fast whenever I even think of resting. I've grown to become extremely jealous of other people around me who sleep just fine and think I'm overreacting. 

It's so, so, so frustrating. So anger inducing. Does it ever get better? Does it get harder to ""fix"" as more and more time passes?

Did you sleep well? Awake refreshed or hungover? Was the taste that bad? What time did you take it? How long did you sleep?

I've run out of options. Anything that raises serotonin is off the table. Temazepam wasn't a restful sleep. Clonidine helped 2 nights, then I didn't sleep at all. Most sleep meds work the first couple of times, then fail. Trazodone did nothing.

Melatonin can help me get to sleep, but I wake up after a couple of hours. Unisom was great a few months ago, but has lost most of it's effectiveness.

1333,"Rso / medical cannabis So if anyone has read my previous points I have stated my sleep doctor gave me klonopin for sleep to take everyday but I’m weary of this and benzos aren’t easy to get off of . Not only that I gained tolerance in 2 days

I have a medical cannabis card and do not want to give up on it. I bought muvs rso called “animal mints” it’s a hybrid 50:50 . Some say it leans more towards indica . I took that 2 hours before bed with peanut butter and 20 mg of cbd tincture from Lazarus naturals. 

I was to read from 11p-1am on the couch with my phone out of reach and wearing orange filtered glasses. I also took 6 mg of melatonin 

I was supposed to get up and go to bed at 1 am and I noticed it was 3 am so I must have fell asleep

I then Vaped some northern lights strain when I woke up  and attempted to use this old cpap machine ( waiting for my at home sleep study for new results and reset cpap). I’ll be honest in the 5 years that I have had it I’ve barely used it because it was uncomfortable and blowing in my eyes . I believe I need a new mask anyways . It’s most likely the mask . So I used an eye sleep mask to not feel the air leaking in my eye making my eye twitch. I believe I fell asleep on and off with the mask on

So yeah maybe there’s hope and I need to alternate sleeping meds. Like 3 days cannabis and 2 days of idk something else but I don’t want to take klonopin 

I’m also journaling everyday to see what happens

I took a lofta sleep study last Friday and it was a easy set up and hopefully I’ll get the results soon

1334,"Eating the wrong foods lead to insomnia I noticed this 4 years ago and it's been getting worse, as in I've become more and more sensitive to what I can eat for dinner. It started with sugary things, like if i had bubbletea or cake after dinner, it would take me longer to fall asleep. In late 2019, i had a cup of bubbletea after dinner and it kept me up the whole night. So i stopped drinking bubbletea in the evening and would only drink it in the morning or early afternoon and slept with no problems. The plus side of this whole thing is i can still eat whatever i want for lunch and since there are enough hours in the day for my body to break down the sugars before bed time, i sleep well as long as i eat sugary or MSG based foods earlier during the day. In late 2020, i ate 5 slices of watermelon after dinner and couldn't fall asleep until 3am. Same thing happened with pineapple on a different day during that same month. So i only eat fruit before 5pm now. I guess I'm hyper sensitive to any sort of sugar now. I've also noticed any sort of sauce with sugar, spices, such as kimchi or curry for dinner would also affect my sleep. I eat very boring dinners now, too afraid to add anything other than salt, black pepper or soy sauce. When i can't sleep at night due to eating the wrong thing, i notice my body feels hot, sometimes i get sweaty. I'm always drinking lots of water in attempt to flush out whatever wrong things i ate for dinner, but my kidneys only work so fast so i lose sleep anyways.

Wondering if anyone else has had this problem. I went to the doctors to get a hormone test for cortisol, creatine, thyroid, melatonin, and a metabolism test but the results all came back normal. Also tested for diabetes and doc said i was fine. Doctors just don't know what's wrong with me. At this point i am so lost on what to do because it's a hassle everytime I'm out and friends want to grab dinner but i tell them i have all these restrictions of what i can't eat and that it weirdly somehow affects my sleep. I feel like i sound crazy when i start to explain this and sometimes it feels like people don't even believe me.

1338,"I finally got 8 hours of sleep again! And some anxiety-tips that helped me Hey everyone!

This forum has been really helpful for me and I want to give something back, so I’ll tell some things that has helped me immensely. 

I have been having anxiety-induced insomnia lately sleeping a max of 2-3 hours each night. I had, and still have to some degree, intense heart palpitations, and a heart rate like I just ran a sprint every time I laid down in my bed. Everyone who’ve tried knows how absolutely horrible it is and how much worse you’re anxiety gets because of it. 

I’ve been taking 2mg melatonin pills every night but they haven’t really helped that much. After reading some posts in here about sleep I kept tripping over valerian root. AND HOLY SHIT DID IT KNOCK ME RIGHT THE FUCK OUT. 
I still woke a couple of times due to the trademark anxiety-feeling in my stomach and chest, but my heart rate didn’t put my body into fight or flight mode, so I was able to fall asleep again. 

2mg of melatonin and 300mg of valerian root was a godsend! And I hope that it will be as effective tonight!

Other than this I keep a daily anxiety-journal where I jut down everything that triggers me during the day. I kinda helps getting my thoughts written down. 

For the hypochondriacs like me out there worrying about insane unicorn sleep-diseases like FFI and SFI: make a ‘reasons it’s stupid to think I have this disease’ and ‘reasons it make sense that I have this disease’. Because I absolutely guarantee you, that your ‘stupid list’ will be more than twice as long. 
In SFI sleep-deprivation is on of the later symptoms. If you get to that part of the disease, you’re so sick you probably won’t notice you can’t sleep. 
And unless anyone in your family has FFI then there’s no reason for you to worry. As far my knowledge goes, every family that has the specific mutation that CAN give them FFI is on a watchlist.

1344,"Difference between circadian and non-circadian sleep-wake phase disorder! 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Today I learnt that, of people who suffer from sleep-wake phase disorder:

1. approximately 50% have circadian sleep-wake phase disorder; and
2. approximately 50% have non-circadian sleep-wake phase disorder.

Source:   [Delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5803043/)

What is the significance of this?  Perhaps it's important in explaining why melatonin doesn't seem to work as an instant solution to many who suffer from sleep-wake phase disorder (i.e it doesn't work on those whose sleep-wake phase disorder is non-circadian).

Is there anyone here who suffers from sleep-wake phase disorder and for whom melatonin didn't work to solve your problem?",Melatonin
1345,"Insomnia paradox This paradox related to insomnia in which if you care less about your sleep and its quality - makes you sleep better is insane. For the last few months I was trying to go to bed and wake up at the same time, limiting my blue light exposure, sleep restriction, valerian root, melatonin, magnesium and sometimes even a little alprazolam. Also trying to not drink a lot of water and not eating right before sleep. I was doing all the known techniques to achieve a restful sleep and it did not really work (besides the alprazolam).

Yesterday there was a change...

Yesterday evening I was so prepared I will not sleep that for the first time I REALLY stopped caring if I sleep or I dont. I was delaying my sleep, just browsing internet, scrolled reddit posts and stuff. And I was like, frick it... If I wont sleep nothing really happens besides feeling shitty for the upcoming day (been there, done that). I went to bed with a mindset of ""I will just close my eyes and chill, I know I will not sleep so atleast I relax a little bit"" and I really felt that yesterday it was the first time I completely did let go of the idea of trying to sleep. And boom, I went out like a light at around 2am after I ended my youtube binge and closed ny eyes. Slept 6 hours, woke up, felt refreshed, ready to go. I was having an exam from criminology at 9am and I even aced it. I guess from this day I will just care less about my sleeping. I do not know if it is really healthy staying up late, changing my sleep wake up times a lot but the less I try to control it the better I sleep it seems. I know that my sleep anxiety wont cure in one day of sleeping good but atleast I see now that I still can manage to get a good night's rest (and so do you!!!) because lately I was feeling like being the worst sleeper ever.",Melatonin

I'm currently taking venaflaxine for anxiety/depression and am in therapy for both, including being analyzed to see why my brain is the way it is and to hopefully, find a medication that will help me function as a real adult.

I can't seem to fall asleep, much less stay asleep.  I'm sensative to light and sound and sleep in a pitch black room with fans and the best earplugs you can get.  I've tried all variations of melatonin (up to 30 mg)  and other OTC meds like tylenol pm to help me fall asleep and on average, it works 10% of the time, if im really lucky.  I'm also prescribed Xanax to try and help but while it soothes bumps, it does not induce sleep.

The last few days it's been terrible.  I've had to call off work because the lack of sleep is making me physically ill and I cant keep doing that.  I have an appointment in 2 weeks to see if there's something that can be prescribed.

1357,"Severe Sleep Anxiety from Sleep Maintenance Insomnia, and Sleep Misperception. Okay so here is some background:  I am a 20 years old college student. I have always been an extreme night owl. For years (since probably the start of Covid in March 2020) I have been going to bed between 2am-5am. I get very energetic around 8pm (I do gymnastics, and our practices have been 9pm-11pm for years). And when I am not doing gymnastics, I used to do huge workouts in my room till 3am, or party and drink until 5am, and then sleep soundly for 8-9 hours until nearly 1pm. Every. Single. Day. I always looked forward to nighttime. I have basically been circadian reversed for years. I also was diagnosed with hypochondria/general anxiety & ADHD years ago. 

So, this basically started the first day of break. I had to get up at 7am to take a final in person (I haven't gotten up this early in years), and then do a 10 hour drive home (well actually, to an airbnb my mom was renting for the winter). This night I kept trying to go to sleep early to no avail, so I ended up going to bed around 5:30am. Since I only had a few hours of sleep, I decided to take a nap before doing my drive, I ended up sleeping for 4 hours (until around 3pm), then I did my drive. The following night I tried to go to bed early again... This is when the anxiety started. I tried absolutely EVERYTHING to get myself to sleep, and it literally was making me go crazy. I ended up falling asleep at around 8am and then was woken up at 10am by my mom. 

Since then it went downhill. There were a few nights where I couldn't sleep at all, or I would sleep in only 20 minute intervals. Every time it got close to nighttime I had this immense anxiety that I would never sleep again. I was so obsessed with it. Like, I am telling you, it consumed me (and still has). I drove my family crazy, talking about it 24/7. I was constantly monitoring how much time it took me to fall asleep, how many hours I got etc. Every night I would start to panic right as I got into bed literally feeling like I was going crazy. I haven't felt sleep deprived in years, so the symptoms of that started to scare me too. 

I continued to have trouble sleeping, in all this time I have not had one good night of sleep. In general it would take me 2-4 hours to fall asleep, and when I did finally sleep it would only be for 4-6 hours and I felt conscious the entire time. My doctor said that I am probably sleeping more than I think. She prescribed Prozac for me. I haven't been medicated for anxiety in over 7 years, so I am trying to wait to see if this will eventually let up when school break is over. It will be over in about 2.5 weeks. 

&#x200B;

Now my problem is less of falling asleep (I have been practicing good sleep hygiene) but staying asleep. I seem to be only capable of sleeping 3-5 hours. I wake up feeling anxious, stressed, and extremely fatigued. I usually immediately look at the clock, then I try to fall asleep again. I feel like I sleep very lightly for another 3-4 hours. It is a very anxious, restless sleep and I feel like I am aware the entire time. It's agonizing. I always wake up feeling more tired than before. I worry about the sleep deprivation symptoms throughout the whole day. I am always worried that I may fait, or go crazy or sink into depression. I also worry that this will never end. I know a lot of these symptoms are exaggerated by my hypocondria anxiety. But I feel like even just ONE goodnight deep sleep will cure everything. I have tried everything. I exercise regularly (even did some gymnastics again over this school break -gymnastics has been a lifesaving outlet for my anxiety and ADHD in the past), I go about my regular day - and I feel normal when doing all these things, until the anxiety creeps back in. The second I have time to think, it starts again and all the symptoms start again. I have tried Benadryl, melatonin, good sleep hygiene, cut out alcohol, going to bed at the same time, literally everything. I have slept in 6 different locations (so it's not attributed to location). I'm so worried this will never end, and all I want to do is love the nighttime again and be able to feel refreshed after sleeping again. I really don't want to have to take this Prozac - it's a last resort, but sometimes I really feel so anxious at night that I might as well check myself into a mental hospital and be given a strong sedative. Funny enough is I just finished my degree in psychology, and seem to have trouble with my own issues. I tried CBT on myself, it seems to only be a temporary relief. The second my eyes close at night I get anxious. Any tips for managing the sleep problems and the anxiety it has caused?",Melatonin
1358,"Diphenhydramine Dependence I'm 35 & have always had some sleep issues. Several years ago, I started taking over the counter diphenhydramine sleep aids at night.

I'm dealing with insomnia for a year or so, the cause is not really clear but is probably related to my bipolar disorder. I've tried several sleeping pills with mixed results. My psychiatrist will not prescribe trazodone or remeron. I've tried otc stuff like unisom and also phenergan but I tend to get terrible headaches from these. I can't use weed. 

 I'm trying to find a schedule cycling different sleeping aids. I'm hoping to avoid tolerance and addiction, and I also hope to be able to use these meds for longer periods without negative side effects. My doctor is fine with this idea. I'm hoping you can provide some more ideas. 


My schedule:

- melatonin, 1 or 2 mg, 3/4 times per week (I get maybe 5 hours of broken sleep, I wake up 3 times at least)

- quetiapine, 12,5 mg, 2 times per week (does work very well but sometimes I get a nasty next day hangover)

- restoril, 10mg., 1 time per week (works great)

- zolpidem, 5 mg., 1 time per week (I sleep for five hours and then I'm unable to get to sleep again).


I'm thinking of swapping the zolpidem for zopiclone, hoping that might work longer.

1362,"Newbie here 💤😪 Hello everyone! 👋 New to Reddit and the ‘insomnia club’ haha. Just wanted to pop in on the fun and kinda share my newbie insomniac story. I’ve read through some posts on here and i have to say, it just feels so reassuring to know I’m not alone!! Crazy that some of you guys have had insomnia for years, yikes… I can only imagine!

So here’s the story. After I went to visit the doctor to discuss my sleep and possible depression meds, I started to have severe insomnia.
He had prescribed me both Prozac and Seroquel and the 4th day in of taking them, I started getting panic attacks that would wake me up at night. I thought they were side effects of the Seroquel at the time, but they turned out to be panic attacks. One night I had taken 2 Benadryl and 5 mg of melatonin and woke straight up with a severe panic attack which scared the crap out of me. I’ve had some small attacks with triggers before in the past but never had them involuntarily, this bad and at night before.  They started to happen during the day as well. After that, I literally couldn’t sleep for nearly 4 days straight and got anxious I might have FFI haha… but I got over it eventually lol… was having slight insomnia before but never this bad so it scared me haha! On average I was getting about 1-2 hours of sleep a night for two weeks. The anxiety has been the worst it’s ever been just coming on without my consent through the day and night. I one night went to the ER because my resting heart rate went up to 150 bpm and I had developed chest pain/tightness only on my left side that was spreading to my arm. Checked me and everything looked optimal and confirmed possible dehydration and anxiety. 
It’s gotten a bit better since, through keeping a decent sleep routine and relaxing activities. I sleep probably 3-4 hours a day now at most and I’m on my way to CBT tomorrow and had my med changed to Zoloft with Propranolol for my heart rate just in case it’s too high for comfort.

 I took my first dose Saturday night, .1 mg with 300 mcg melatonin. I slept 7 hours. However, yesterday my Blood pressure was fluctuating up and down 20 points. Dr and Pharmacist were both puzzled. Skipped it last night since BP was dipping down, but I really want to take it if BP doesn't go too low. BP today has been higher than usual, but could be from lack of sleep. Last night I went 100/60 tp 120/74 for 5 different readings in 2 hours. 1 reading 98/59, but then back up in 5 minutes.

How much is it supposed to  lower your BP?   Dr said could be rebound from Clonidine, Pharmacist said that's usually after continued use. 

I hope someone who has experience prescribing this will respond. My Dr is very caring, but this is a new area for her, and she's telling me what the literature says. 

Should I take .1 mg if my BP is 100/60, or is a half dose ok? If BP is 120/75, should I take .1 mg, even though BP was  fluctuating low the 1st dose?

So I’ve been battling progressive insomnia for years, but it severely escalated after my I had my son 5 years ago. Obvious explanations would be the terrible baby sleep and regression. Well, it got worse.. and then it got so bad I was in the ER cause I didn’t sleep for 4 days. Ever since I went through medications (shelf and prescriptions) til I found something that worked for me. But I’m maxed out. I take 10mg Ambien and have to add 10-20mg of melatonin. 

This works for me pretty well. It doesn’t affect me nor do I have the allergies like to Unisom. Though I have the issue where I cant sleep without the ambien now. So when I run out because of holidays or any other inconvenience, I’m pretty much screwed.

So here we are, on a Sunday night, night 2 without my meds, and no sleep.

So if I can’t get an appointment on the day I’m allowed a refill, well heck might as well learn origami cause sleep isn’t happening. Taking more melatonin doesn’t help either it actually reactivates any of my adhd meds I still have in my system and suddenly I’m REALLY awake. Any ideas?",Melatonin

1373,"Some tips that helped me recently Since late sept when my mom had a heart attack (thankfully she’s alright) I had some serious sleep issues. I’ve never experienced insomnia before and it’s as you all know absolutely terrible sometimes. It started right after the event and I happened to be drinking a lot at the time (quit nov 13). I would sleep from 11-1am, then not fall back asleep until 4am, and only sleep until 7am. That lasted for a while and I stared getting really anxious about it because I never had sleep issues before and it was happening on my days off. Fast forward to when I quit drinking and it got even worse. I’d be lucky to have one night of the week where I slept 8 hours, and would have 1-2 fully sleepless nights a week. I got so worried about it that my norm would be my mind racing until 4am, then I’d sleep until 7:30. I was sleeping 3 hours a night every single night. It was miserable, I would break down every few days and really got deeply depressed. Recently, I have been getting 8 hours again on 80% of nights and I’m really glad it’s coming back. I thought, like many of you, I had SFI or some prion disease. That is not the case. Here are some tips that I deeply internalized that helped me a lot. I used them last night and got 7 1/2 hours. 

1. Let go of all worries about your insomnia. Even if you had a bad night and feel like absolute shit- do not worry about sleep or desire sleep. If your mind is racing, recognize you don’t want that happening, and do not force yourself to sleep. Desiring sleep just makes it so much worse. 

2. Don’t take the herbal / Benadryl / vitamin craze route. I was taking Benadryl, l tryptophan, ashwanghanda, l theanine, melatonin every night and it didn’t help for shit. I just had expectations it would help me sleep and it did not. I only take magnesium around 5pm now. Once I stopped all that crap my sleep got a bit better. 

3. Work out a lot before 5pm, and don’t eat late. 

4. This one may have helped me the most- get sunlight during the day, and get a lot of darkness at night. 2 hours of no screens, just darkness before bed. It’s hard but really resets the internal clock. 

5. Eat healthy. A few foods that seem to really help me are bananas, almonds, and milk of any sort. Food is so key in getting your body’s natural l tryptophan / melatonin. 

6. Don’t worry about hypnic jerks. They are annoying af, but try not to stress about them. I would just get up after they happened, take a max strength Tylenol, have a shower then go back to bed. 

7. When your mind is racing at night, convince yourself, or internalize, you need it to shut up and save the thoughts for tomorrow. I like to imagine I am in a forest as a firefighter, and every thought is a flame I put out, once all the fires are out, you are walking through a clear forest (your mind is cleared) then try to just lay there and relax. Don’t think, don’t desire the sleep, just let it happen. 

All these things took me a while to do consistently but I promise it could help you. I thought something was seriously wrong with my brain but it just took some training and mindfulness. Alcohol really fucked my sleep also so stay away from it if you are having trouble sleeping. I wish you all the best in this crazy journey. YOU CAN SLEEP. DONT BE ANXIOUS / DISCOURAGED ABOUT IT ANYMORE! Sweet vivid dreams y’all.
Oh one more - banish the clock. Don’t look at it. Or if you do, don’t worry about how late it’s getting. Tell yourself, it’s not too late to fall asleep, 4am is too late to fall asleep haha. Reduce that anxiety.",Melatonin
1374,"Some hope So someone nicely on Reddit told me to start a sleep hygiene where I don’t go to bed until I’m sleepy . So the last 2 days I’ve sat on my couch 2 hours before bedtime, dimmed my phone to blue light ( it has a schedule to turn on) and read a book with some melatonin.

They said absolutely no caffeine. I usually drink green tea or coffee but the past few days I’ve had no caffeine . It’s not easy but I think they are onto something with the caffeine thing 

Last night I Was on the couch and briefly fell asleep after watching “ the good doctor” with nothing in my system . Caught myself snoring and woke up. Read a book from 12p-1am with orange filtered  glasses and took a melatonin. Was supposed to immediately take klonopin ( was given to me days ago)and go to bed at 1 am but looked at my clock at it said 1:36 so maybe I accidentally fell asleep . Went to bed after taking klonopin  , put my phone away from my bed with some background noise and fell asleep. Woke up at 7am. Got out of bed and read a book. Went back to bed and I think I accidentally fell asleep past the alarm which never happens . I was supposed to get up at 8am so get ready for work at 9 am and woke up and it said 820am

I had no caffeine at all saturday

I don’t plan on making klonopin a daily thing and would like to continue doing this routine with sleep and see how it goes. This has given me hope . All I need now is to do a at home sleep study 

If anyone else has any tips I can use pls let me know. I think reading before bed might be slowing down my thoughts so if anyone has anymore sleep hygiene recommend books let me know 

I’ve been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and depression  long ago  and will be seeing a psych nurse soon to go over maybe some meds for it and maybe I won’t need the klonopin . Right now I’m not on any ssris 

Thanks",Melatonin

1376,"My experience and advice regarding chronic insomnia and CBTI I see a lot of people struggling with things I’ve struggled with -  and have been fortunate to overcome, for the moment - so I’m sharing my experience to offer a little advice and hope. Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll answer as best I can. 

I’m not sure what prompted my insomnia or why, but since around 2018, I’ve had months in which I slept totally fine (6-8 hours), followed by months in which I didn’t (0-3 hours). When I didn’t, I’d become deeply anxious and depressed. I’d worry about getting into a traffic accident on my drive to work, not being able to maintain personal relationships, never sleeping again, going insane, dying, etc. 

I tried Zzzquil, Benadryl, Melatonin, and alcohol. They made me feel more tired, but I wouldn’t fall asleep - and I’d often feel groggy the next day. The only thing that worked for me was ambien, in that I could take it and then legit fall asleep 20 minutes later, but I’d only stay asleep for 3 hours, and once I was up I was up for good. Nevertheless, this was my best option. 

So I’d get in bed at 9pm and try to fall asleep naturally, which would never happen, and then at 12am I’d take ambien and sleep till 3am, then lay in bed awake till 6am and drink coffee and start my day. 

Most recently, I took ambien every night for four months straight and was averaging about 20 hours of sleep a week.

My doctor referred me to the UCLA insomnia clinic and I met with them. They determined that I didn’t have sleep apnea, and that my insomnia was likely triggered by anxiety. They didn’t think medication would help me. They offered me CBTI (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia) and framed it as “teaching me how to sleep again.”

Seemed like BS - I desperately wanted better meds - but two months later I was sleeping 6 hours a night and taking way less ambien.

Here are some things that I think helped me get there:

REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

Before CBTI, I was under the impression that I’m supposed to get 8 hours of sleep a night. Wrong. I learned that healthy people tend to sleep 6-7 hours a night, and can function adequately with only 5 hours. I was also under the impression that you needed to sleep for an extended period to get the benefits of rem sleep or whatever. Also wrong. After digesting this, I became less stressed about being behind on sleep because I wasn’t as far behind as I thought. 

BUFFER ZONE

My therapist recommended I set up a cozy area to read a book and chill for an hour or two before going to my bedroom (No TV/phone/screens/etc.). Then, if/when I can’t sleep, leave the bedroom and go back to that area to read more until I’m tired and then go back to the bedroom to try sleeping again. The idea is to not be in bed when I’m not sleeping, and be really strict about it. Felt like BS at first, but totally worked. 

WORRY JOURNAL

I had a lot of anxiety, and was encouraged to write down my worries (getting in a traffic accident, for example), and then think about whether those worries had ever come true. They hadn’t. It put things in perspective and the anxiety waned. It was also helpful to think about what I have control over and what I don’t have control over. If it’s out of my control, it’s not worth worrying about. If it is in my control, then if I write down a plan I can stop stressing about it. 

SLEEP RESTRICTION

Before CBTI, I was in bed 9-10 hours a night because I was trying to give myself the best opportunity to get sleep. I didn’t realize this at the time, but by staying awake in bed for 6+ hours a night, I’d formed an unhealthy association between my bed and wakefulness. I needed to break that. So, as part of my treatment, I could only be in bed from 11:30pm to 6:00am. If I didn’t sleep well during that window, I would just get more tired and more likely sleep better the next night. This was frustrating at first, but ultimately worked. I began sleeping nearly 6 hours a night without ambien, which I’d thought was impossible.",Melatonin

I basically just let myself do whatever until I get exhausted enough to sleep. Which is super inconvenient when you’re a high school student who has to get  up at six every morning. Nothing helps.

1384,"Coming off of hydroxyzine, melatonin, and Seroquel(been off Seroquel for a week) A week ago I finished tapering down from Seroquel to the point where I finally got off of it so I started taking hydroxyzine and melatonin to help sleep because I couldn’t sleep at all without anything and with melatonin by itself I still couldn’t sleep. I added in the hydroxyzine along with the melatonin and slept fine for about a week until last night when I decided to only take the hydroxyzine and stop taking melatonin with it. I slept but not as well. Fast forward to tonight when I decided that it’s time to stop taking the hydroxyzine as well and I’m wide awake in my bed with the worse headache of my life.

Edit: I decided to take hydroxyzine 25mg and melatonin 5mg. Idk how I’m going to get off these drugs without pulling multiple all nighters. I’m pissed now because I could’ve taken them earlier instead of lying in bed for 3 or 4 hours with my eyes shut.",Melatonin

1386,"How I significantly improved my insomnia (long) (TL;DR at bottom)

I know there's no one size fits all cure. I am not preaching this and saying you have to do any of this, but I thought it would be good to post this because this is what I did, and it worked for my insomnia. It has been almost a year and I've had waaaaay less issues with insomnia. It usually only takes about 2 hours to fall asleep at the most and I usually get 8 - 9 hours of sleep. It's been about 10 months since I've had an all-nighter. Huge win for me. I am no longer in fear going to bed like I once was. My fear of bed/sleep has gone down from a 9/10 to a 2/10.

My history is a very long and confusing one and actually the main problem in my life was and still is chronic nerve pain. I worked very hard at healing myself through many treatmets and avenues and even though it did not cure my pain, it helped with my second biggest problem, insomnia. It is wildly better. Right now as I type this I'm really scared that I am going to jynx things and cause myself to have insomnia tonight because I am now talking about it but it's a risk I'm going to take because I know the suffering of insomnia is so real, and if I can help even one person that would be amazing. Again I am not forcing this on anyone, this is just what I did. 

For two years I struggled with moderate-severe insomnia. One of two things would happen. I would go to bed at 11 pm and not be able to fall asleep until 5 or 6 am, or I would stay up all night. Longest I've gone without sleep would be about 85 hours. This all while I was on baclofen and quetiapine. I also suffered with tremors, jolts, vibrating and many strange things that my body/nervous system does while lying in bed. I still suffer with those things but not as badly. 

I have been on quetiapine since 2014 and put me to sleep easily for yearss. Then in 2019 it just suddenly stopped working as it usually did. (I am still on it and it feels like it's kinda back to how it use to work).

I started (and still am) taking a million supplements but the ones that I think helped with sleep are magnesium bisclycinate 400 mg and L-theanine 200 mg. Also two drops of liquid vitamin D. I take that every night about an hour before bed. If anyone would like the full list of supplements I take just ask.

Because of suicidal ideation, how severe my pain was, my history of anxiety, and a psychotic episode I had at my psychiatrist's office, he prescribed me with .25 mg of clonazepam which I take once a day in the afternoon. I know benzos are bad for you long term but I don't care lol. It's something I literally can't care about right now. But it likely helped my nervous system calm down and let my body regulate sleep again. I do not take it at night nor do I take it **to** go to sleep. I just feel it's only fair for me to mention that I'm on it. So now I'm on baclofen, clonazepam and quetiapine which can be dangerous but it's what Ive been on for a year and my pharmacy is aware and I have been fine. Just warning others out there that the combination of those drugs can cause laboured breathing. **I am not trying to endorse benzo use just want to say that I am on clonazepam to give full transparency**

I work-out for about 15 - 30 minutes almost every day, in summer I took walks, now in winter I go to a gym, treadmill, elliptical, stairmaster. Or i do 2-4 hours of heavy duty house cleaning, or dancing, lol. Literally I went only two days without exercise recently and my body was twitching, jolting and vibrating more than normal and it took me about 2.5 hours to fall asleep, tossing and turning constantly. I literally **have** to exercise and cannot go more than 2 days without exercise or my body has too much excess energy and will feel jumpy at night and I will not sleep properly. I am trapped, I literally have to exercise.

I do yoga/stretch almost every night for 10 minutes. I know yoga is the most annoying suggestion in the world lol but again, I'm just stating what I do and what I have incorporated into my life over the past year. Usually the stretching/yoga I do involves deep breathing. I can post the video of which yoga exercise I do the most often if anyone is interested. It's beginner aka easy to do.

This one is the most ""out there"" and probably going to get laughed at, but I don't give a shit because it helps me relax before going to sleep. And as you all know, when you're suffering you'll try just about anything. I do EFT tapping every single night. It is a form of meditation. I use an app and if anyone wants more details on it, just ask me and I'll tell you. I just don't want it to sound like I'm trying to sell something. I do two guided meditations before bed, one of them is  behind the paywall and one of them is free, so again if you want to know the app and the name of the free meditation, feel free to ask me. If EFT is too hippie-dippie then alternatively I just recommend doing traditional meditation for 10 minutes a night. But the reason I do ""tapping"" meditation is because ironically, traditional meditation gives me anxiety for some reason. So I do tapping because I can focus and relax WAY better. 

I do not consume caffeine or stimulants.

I quit smoking/vaping/nicotine.

Over the course of 6 months I got about 10 vitamin B12 shots. Low B12 contributes to poor melatonin production.

I changed my diet for the purposes of improving my gut microbiome, reducing chronic pain and inflammation, and overall health. I do not know if this helped my sleep but I do personally feel like it played a part in helping my sleep. No grains, no sugar (except 2 - 3 servings of fruit a day) , no dairy. Essentially paleo diet. For 3 months I only ate meat, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans and some fruit. Dramatically reduced my sugar intake. When you consume too much sugar your adrenaline shoots up. Breads and pastas spike your blood sugar and has basically the same effect. If that sounds too intense, consider keto diet where you can still eat butter and cheese. Or, the way I started off was, I just cut out sugar and flour. So I still ate dairy like plain yogurt and milk and grains like rice and oatmeal. Then I progressed to paleo. Now i do relaxed paleo. So I eat a lot of meat and vegetables, beans, nuts and seeds, 2 fruits a day, and i'll have grains, dairy and sugar like once every 3 days or something.

I get an hour massage once a month. Fuck it feels good.

And this one, which may be the most important: **journalling**. I know this sounds **fucking stupid** but it is very good for your brain and nervous system to journal. I do it once every two days for 10 - 20 minutes. The key here isn't to write eloquent entries, but rather to get emotions and negative thoughts onto the page. Things that bother you, current stressors, past stressors, anxieties, emotions, dive deep if you can and be extremely honest. Write-out things that are not meant for anyone to read, write our your most raw and horrible thoughts. Let yourself cry if you feel like you need to. If all that's too intense for you to start off with, just write about insignificant things like someone who was rude to you today. Seriously it sounds dumb but it honestly feels like you are getting rid of shit that's stuck in you. Slowly over time you'll notice your mind is going only 1000 miles a minute at bedtime instead of a 10,000 miles a minute. 

And every night before bed I ""talk to my brain"". I know it sounds ridiculous. But i say something like ""I am safe. You are safe. My body is at peace. It is time to rest and I am safe. I love myself."" Lol

And also my thing is falling asleep to 1 - 2 hour youtube videos where its either an interview/podcast show or some teenager talking about some movie lol.

And the very last thing is, once in a while when I do really struggle and the fear that I won't sleep hits me, I take half of a robaxasol (muscle relaxant). 

I truly hope this post wasn't triggering to anyone because I understand there is nothing more frustrating seeing suggestions you've tried that didn't work. Or seeing fluff suggestions like yoga...very annoying. Keep in mind I still have terrible chronic pain and am on disability despite overhauling my entire life trying to get better and putting all of my willpower into my new self-care lifestyle. I couldn't solve my pain but my sleep got so much better and I am grateful for that. 

**TL;DR:** Supplements - magnesium bisglycinate and L-theanine and liquid vitamin D every night, almost daily exercise 15-30 min, almost daily stretch/yoga 10 min, EFT tapping and/or meditation 10 minutes, paleo diet (dramatically reduced sugar intake), massages, journal for 10-20 min once every two days

A lot of it may sound silly but never underestimate the power of calming your nervous system down. By doing the things I discussed you are calming down your nervous system and telling your nervous system that it's safe. Safety = rest & repair.

Again if anyone wants me to talk more about a topic just ask. Like I said I take a million supplements and stuff.",Melatonin
1387,"Worse Insomnia Than Anyone I’ve Ever Met Hello everyone,

My name is Joey.

Some time around March of this year, I started losing sleep. As is often the case, what started as imperceptible has become a full-on crisis of chronic insomnia. I will flat-out not sleep at all for nights at a time before passing out from exhaustion. About two weeks ago, I admitted myself to the psychiatric ward for it. They put me on 300mg of trileptol twice a day and 60mg of geodon at night. For the first week I was getting good sleep as a result of the drowsiness from the geodon, but that effect has worn off and my insomnia has returned with a vengeance.

I don’t know what to do anymore. People don’t even believe me when I describe the severity of my insomnia because I’m still managing to function, so they assume that I’m exaggerating. But I literally will not sleep at all some nights. I envy those of you who are worried about 5 hours of sleep a night. 5 hours of sleep every night would have me feeling like a million bucks. Not to undermine anyone else’s suffering, but I feel completely alone in this battle. I’m seeing an insomnia clinic as well, but it’s very early and I haven’t benefited yet. I just missed an appointment because sticking to a schedule has become somewhat difficult… shocker. I’m keeping it together at work, but barely.

It is also worth noting that I got out of a 10-year relationship in February of last year, just before COVID hit. I also went off of Effexor the previous year and quit drinking over the course of this last year, and my drinking was pretty severe before that. I know it’s anxiety and trauma and maybe even prolonged withdrawals, but it doesn’t matter. I feel as though I’ve tried everything. I’ve literally prayed for a miracle on multiple occasions. I’m losing hair every day from the stress and anxiety surrounding my sleep. It’ll be visibly thin before long at this rate.

I was taking Benadryl for a month and that stopped working. I was taking NyQuil for a month and that stopped working. I was taking CBD and melatonin gummies and those stopped working. I’m about to try magnesium and tryptophan. Wish me luck. And any advice would be immensely appreciated. Thank you.",Melatonin
1388,"Pregnant, Severe Insomnia, Having Anxiety Attacks Every Night This is my 4th pregnancy (1st ended in a loss at 8 weeks.) My first two pregnancies were like miracles. During the first trimester, I could sleep perfectly without meds for the first time since I was 17 (I’m 38 now.) My 3rd pregnancy, the effect wasn’t quite as strong, but was enough that I only needed to take 12.5 mg of Seroquel to fall asleep.

Note: All of these were for 1st trimester only. My 1st pregnancy, I was taking 25 mg Seroquel a night by the end, whereas the 3rd I was actually taking 800 mg by the end (while only prescribed 300.) During the 3rd, I also began taking Ambien in my 3rd trimester, sometimes 30 mg per night. Luckily, both babies were totally healthy and bright. (Youngest is 2 now.)

This pregnancy is totally different. I’m not even 5 weeks along, and my insomnia has gotten way, way worse instead of better. I’ve been having massive anxiety attacks every night. They make my heart pound and make me feel like I have to jump out of my skin. I thrash around in bed like a beached fish while my brain blares alarm signals at me.

Last night, I took 800 mg Seroquel, 12 mg melatonin, 4 benedryl, and 4 unisoms, then when my anxiety attack overtook me (worst one yet), I chewed up 15 mg klonopin, because at that point I cared more about stopping the anxiety than anything else in the world, including the health of my embryo. (I have a very high benzo tolerance.)

I just don’t know what to do. Other (so far unused) meds in my roster include Trazodone, Phenibut, Ambien, and Propranolol. Tonight I’m thinking of trying 500 mg Seroquel, 3 (100 mg?) Trazodone, and 20 mg Propranolol.

I just don’t know what to do without potentially harming my baby, but at this point I value my mental health higher, especially because I’m not even sure I want a 3rd kid (husband’s idea). Sorry for the novel—I’m just looking for suggestions or anyone else’s experiences with severe insomnia during pregnancy.",Melatonin

 I hate the idea of a benzo for obvious reasons. YES, I don't need to hear benzo horror stories. 5 months of insomnia and 14 Dr visits, 3 Drs, etc, etc, etc. I've explored everything. 2 Docs suggested this as a possibility. NOT daily use.

I don't need to hear pros and cons for daily use. I WON'T be doing that.

Has anyone used .5-1mg Clonazepam once or twice a week for insomnia? I can deal with 2-3 hours sleep the other days if I can get a few 6+ hour days. I tried 1 mg twice. It took  2 hours to fall asleep, but I got 6-7 hours without the zombie hangover.  I thought it would make me drowsy like Melatonin or unisom, but I never felt anything, just was able to go to sleep.

None of the other sleep meds work well, even on a rotating basis. Please don't suggest one here. I've got other posts for those.

Hello redditors, just wanted to ask ways that work for you guys to fall asleep since everything i've tried has been not working for the past 3 years, i've tried so many ways to sleep and every schedule, doing excercise, work, no tech 2-4 hours before bedtime, all of them in one day and still i can't sleep, i've dosed myself with melatonin but it doesn't seem to work either since i am stupidly tough for meds even though i don't usually take them.

I've dosed myself with 2, 5, 7 and even 18mg of melatonin and none of them did anything, when i get to sleep well which is kinda rare i sleep for 12-16 hours and still wake up tired, which also gets worse if i don't get a good sleep the next day, usually i get through the day with 2-4 hours of sleep, and i don't want to be used to that anymore.

I've tried looking for help with my family but they have just keeping away meds from me (kinda understandable since i had a mental breakdown a year ago and tried to kill myself so i could rest) but they don't take me to a doctor or anything, at this point i'm just working so i can go by myself to a doctor and fix me since i seem to not have any support from my family, anyways.

1392,"Lifelong insomniac desperate to sleep, these are the things I’ve tried. What should I try next? My issue is falling asleep, not so much staying asleep. But I can lay awake for hours upon hours trying to get there, or miss full nights. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember and I’m in my 30s now. I don’t want to live this way the rest of my life. My insomnia comes and goes in waves but when it hits it can last months. It never goes for that long.

Here’s what I’ve tried:

Ambien
- Did not help me fall asleep, so left me awake and hallucinating.

Cannabis
- I’m a fan of cannabis in a general sense. It does not help me fall asleep.

Isolated cannabinoids (CBN, CBD)
- CBN helped for a very short while but then I kept quickly needing to up the dose. Not financially sustainable. CBD did not work.

Trazadone 
- Made me feel like an absolute zombie the entire day after use. I was functioning at a lower level than I do after a sleepless night.

Xanax 
- Works like a charm but I refuse to take it often because I refuse to become dependent/addicted.

Melatonin
- Gives me fucked up nightmares and unrestful sleep.

Magnesium 
- Did not help me sleep, and made me feel unwell.

Sleep apps
- Totally hit or miss if it will work.

Breathing exercises 
- Does not work 

Relaxing music/sound machines 
- Does not work

A coworker suggested valerian root, so I’ll give that a go next. Maybe it will be the miracle I’ve been waiting for. But considering my track record, if not, do you have any other suggestions for me to try? I will try anything within reason at this point.

I daydream alot. How scenarios could have been different, me expecting the worst of possible outcomes. Mostly negative or worrisome thoughts. The entire world races past me in this state as i blankly fufill my day to day tasks.

Clonzapam .5mg: Works beautifully, but i only take it once a week to avoid tolerance buildup. Its my last resort and only reliable crux

For a while, Zzzquil pure zzzs with chamomile and lavender helped probably half of the time, but now I sleep 3-4 hours and wake up with racing thoughts and anxiety, only able to sleep maybe 30 minutes of the next 3 hours laying in bed.

When I take Unisom sleeptabs (just 1/2 of a tab), it seems to work more often. I can usually sleep 6 hours or so and maybe 1 out of 3 nights, I won’t sleep more than 3-4 hours with it. 

L-Theanine I haven’t really found a way for it to help much with sleep. When I take 100mg during the day, it makes me feel a bit cloudy for an hour or so, then it wears off I guess? If I take 100mg or even 200mg at night, it doesn’t seem to do much of anything. 

I try not to combine these due to potential interactions and side effects. Clearly, if it was the safest, I’d take the Unisom every night. However, I’ve read it can lead to early onset dementia, and also the more that we use it the more likely it is not to work as well.

My struggle now is battling recovering and the constant brain waves. Sounds like a gift, right? Here’s the backstory; from 2020 to mid 2021 I fell into a significant depression between work and relationships and whatnot. I know what depression feels like and I was depressed. I averaged 3.5 hours or less per night over the course of that time. Some nights I got 2. Some nights I managed 6 or so. Mid 2021, I made a huge decision and it couldn’t have improved things better for me. Job is good. Relationship is good. Everything is perfect and I’m generally happy. Problem is that I cannot stop sleeping now. Ever since I started being able to get more sleep, I get 8 hours and then am falling asleep at my desk mid morning at work. 9 hours, same thing. For the first couple of months, I thought my body was just catching up. It has to be caught up. I’m concerned that I’ve developed some sort of natural melatonin overload condition as a result of my body trying to correct the prolonged lack of sleep. Please help. Coffee doesn’t help. Adderall (prescribed) doesn’t do anything. Sleep study is scheduled but months away. I’m perfectly healthy, I run 15-20 miles a week. Not overweight. Decent diet. Is my explanation a possibility? I cannot find an answer on this.

My eyes do this weird jumping thing transitioning to REM while I’m fully conscious and my body, for months, used to do do a jerking & jolting thing automatically.

I was very excited yesterday morning because I dreamed - first time I’ve remembered a weirdo jacked up dream in way over a month. I actually felt human for a few hours. I had forgotten how great it felt to wake up even a little refreshed instead of defeated… I got all the way to REM! 

I decided to just try to rest for a few hours instead of the Pass/Fail exam of sleeping I’ve been doing. Instead of guided meditations I found some sleep hypnosis things on YouTube. I’d listen to one, then acknowledge that I rested a bit, maybe get up and pee, get some water, pet the cat, choose another video. I did this starting at 8:30 and around 3-4a.m. started noticing that I was feeling more “floaty” and relaxed. I liked the affirmations that I was hearing. I started repeating a few from Nick Wright (just stumbled across him). At around 6:00, I took off my headphones and suddenly WOKE from a goofy vivid dream. It was shortly after 8. So, I finally fell asleep, even if for only two hours. I was so excited. I felt almost normal again yesterday, until I got tired, but still like there has been progress. I was kind of excited to try again last night. I hadn’t taken much either, and nothing after I went to bed.

I didn’t sleep last night. I didn’t even feel trance-like or drifts last night. Wtf? It’s like I was resisting the effort. 

Tomorrow will be 8 weeks since I got a decent night’s sleep. One week ago I got a new physician, she has me taking mirtazapine 15mg plus 10mg melatonin at the same time each night. I was doing this, albeit not as regimented, I’m not overly hopeful that in 2-4 weeks I’ll begin sleeping. I’ve also used unisom, Benadryl, trazodone, seroquel, tryptophan, even ambien/zolpidem. My brain has decided to rebel against everything. The ambien worked for 5 hours of crappy sleep - for the first week. Now i don’t fall asleep on any of it.

I don’t know why my brain is fighting sleep so bad. I’m exhausted. I love sleep. There is no joy in telling anyone I still didn’t sleep. Sleep has become unfamiliar. I’m having a very hard time being kind to myself. I don’t understand why I’m “overthrowing” everything. I’m so frustrated. This weekend I tried to accept that this is more than likely psychological. My thyroid was fine. The new physician said there are not tons of things to check. Falling asleep yesterday after hypnosis tracks seemed to verify this.

I haven't injured my legs or anything, but I was wondering if any fellow autistic folks had any advice on how to help? I can't sleep until my legs are better and I really need the sleep, and reference for any future issues.

My doc told me to schedule my sleep. I WISH I COULD, I tried and I cant schedule something that Im not able to do. She wont prescribe me any benzos or Z because Im 19, instead she told me to get some valerian, which I did and is useless.

Worst part is that I have already tried some benzos on my own, and atleast lorazepam doesnt help In the usual doses and I have to take 4mg to sleep (no tolerance at all, have done it a couple times).

Im desperate, I dont want to rely on some chemical but I dont think any chemical can hurt me more than not sleeping does. I have been thinking of changing doctor or buying benzos from somewhere to help me schedule and then see if I can drop them so I can use anything softer.

What do you think, guys?

Edit: have been using melatonine for a while and It kinda helps in the periods I can sleep. But when I cant, it does nothing.

Edit2: Also lately I have been waking up after 4h, sometimes I can sleep again, sometimes not.",Melatonin
1424,"2 days of no sleep Hey guys. I suffer from chronic insomnia like many of you. I've had some really good months this year and some really bad. 

It's hitting me quite harshly right now and I'd like to take this time to air out my frustrations. I haven't slept in two days straight and right now the anxiety hit me and I'm feeling uneasy and loopy. For anyone else suffering and going on for days without sleep, I understand your frustration and know that you are not alone. I haven't been on this thread in a while but it's always nice to see other people's suggestions and I feel I'm in need of that. I currently have work later and it's barely 1PM. I have to drive around like this and I hate it..I don't know how I'm going to get through the day like this I feel like throwing up. I want to try to take a nap but I know they say Naps can throw the sleep schedule off or make it worst. What do you guys suggest I do in order to alleviate myself of this anxiety and what can I do in order to allow myself to get the rest I need tonight. I'm just scared cause I've been suffering with insomnia for 1 year now and how it'll affect my body. My anxiety gets scared to the point that I feel ill die.  Melatonin doesn't help me,, but I was prescribed Ativan which I think I'll take tonight. I just wanted to let all this out. Thank you if you've read thus far",Melatonin

I felt multiple times tonight that I was dosing off, but my mind would jolt me awake. I actually did I think for about a half hour earlier in the night, like 11:30 or something.

Finally my doctor changed my therapy and I’m now taking 15 mg of Mianserine and 7 drops of Klonopin (plus valerian root and melatonin with magnesium that always worked) and now I usually wake up with 6-6:30 hours of sleep and I can manage to get maybe another 30-60 minutes of sleep and that’s it.

Falling asleep is fine. Staying asleep is impossible.

I tried melatonin but it doesn't work for long enough, I wake up. I also read you can't be on it forever, and I've recently been off it after being on it for 3 months. It didn't help during the 3 months and I have no idea how long I need to be off it to ""reset"". It was 10mg and not the slow acting one so maybe that's why?

1429,"Sudden Sleep Issues I have probably scanned this forum for quite some time the last few days (which is definitely attributable to illness anxiety disorder). However, I just wanted to get some input and insight on my current situation—and see if anyone has experienced anything similar?

Last week, I had cold feet which then turned into paresthesia/tingling. This eventually became a sensation that I now feel all over in my hands, arms, feet. This has been followed by widespread twitching. Between all of this, I was experiencing some sleep troubles—waking up multiple times throughout the night and a bit restless. I wasn’t too worried though since I’ve been a restless sleeper before.

However, fast forward to the last few days and my life has been a living hell. I haven’t been able to really go asleep, stay asleep, or even feel tired. After a very restless night of sleep I made the mistake, as everyone appears to have done at some point in this subreddit, of looking up symptoms on Google and coming across SFI/CJD. Since then, I have not been able to really sleep at all.

In the last two days I’ve gotten about 6 hours of sleep total. I fell asleep at 12:50 and woke up at around 3:30 last night and have been awake every since. The night prior, I went to bed and slept from 12-1:30, and then slept until 6:20 shortly after taking NyQuil after having taken melatonin. I wake up wide-eyed and not tired at all, which is new for me and, again, not something I’ve experienced before. When I try to sleep, or have gone to sleep, it feels like I’ve been awake the entire time although I know that isn’t necessarily the case.

This is something I’ve never experienced in my life, so yeah I’m a bit concerned but do know I have severe illness anxiety. Should I be worried? Melatonin doesn’t seem to work, and I don’t “feel” tired. 

My doctor is running blood tests, ordered a sleep study, and is putting me in Lexapro and another medication. The past two days have been very tough, and I’ve been in the verge of a breakdown (crying every few hours).

To summarize:

-27 year old (M)
-No major sleep issues previously, but having trouble sleeping and staying asleep. 
-Do have severe health anxiety. 
-Haven’t been able to sleep very much, anxiety has convinced me it’s SFI/CJD.
-Melatonin doesn’t work. 
-Seen doctor, working in some options.

Thanks.",Melatonin

I don’t get a lot of understanding from my family, none of whom suffer like this, as they just tell me that if I get up early and force myself through the day with little sleep I’ll be ‘tired’ at night. They don’t seem to grasp that tiredness does not lead to sleep for me.

I often suffered from that in the past too, but back then I would rather sleep 3 to 4 hours a night or not sleep for a whole day and not having the feeling that without any sleeping meds I wouldnt sleep at all. I try to not take the sleeping meds that were prescribed to me a week ago (zopiclone) because Im scared of developing physical dependency. I still have some mirtazapine 30mg left that I was prescribed some years ago to treat my depressions. I didnt like them at all because they made me gain 30kg in a really short time as well as the hangover the day after that made be unable doing anything. I remember that I took 3.75mg some weeks ago and could sleep without waking up at all within 30 minutes but I still suffered from the hangover the next day. I really need to be functional the next day because of uni etc. and I feel like Im even more functional without no sleep at all than with the hangover feeling of mirtazapine. Do you think I could even go lower with the dose and take 1mg instead? When do you usually take it? Do you have any tips how to prevent the hangover or how to handle it? For me at least, not even vyvanse or other stimulants would help at all… i tried melatonine, all kind of 1st gen antihistamines and a bunch of other otc sleeping meds including valerian but they wouldnt help at all either… anyways I will try 1mg tonight and see if it works and let you guys know if I dont get an answer before :) thx a lot",Melatonin

1435,"Random Racing Thoughts at Night + Advice? Hey there!

So, I've been experiencing a bout of insomnia since November 12. 

In the past 4 weeks, I've tried melatonin, CDB oil, CBD capsules, and Indica. I've even been prescribed Zopiclone (which didn't even work that well) and now I've recently been prescribed Quetiapine (which I'm genuinely scared of taking too much of because of the research I've done on it). I've also tried meditation and relaxation videos, and am an ASMR fan.

Aside from this I've also been on sertraline for almost two weeks because of anxiety and depression. Do you guys know if that seems to be making it worse?

Anyways, the main point of this post is to describe what I've been feeling at night. When I close my eyes and attempt to sleep, I will start thinking of the most random things, from scenes of t.v. shows, to situations I've lived through all throughout my life, to song lyrics (which seems to be the worst thing because it happens so often). Do any of you guys experience these racing thoughts? They're genuinely awful, and they've made me paranoid of even listening to music.

1439,"Remeron/Mirtazapine question Not my typical shitpost on this account.  Just at the end of my rope really.  I've struggled with insomnia my whole life, been off and on meds throughout the years, have an official diagnosis, but still am having problems.  This year my insomnia has become the worst it's ever been.  This has also been the most stressful year to date.  I've been sick since February and have been diagnosed with IBS, still getting it fully under control.  Realized I'm likely on the spectrum and am on a waitlist for testing.  Almost lost my condo and was forced to sell and come clean to everyone in my life about financial difficulties (since resolved through sale of the condo, even bought a house to live in).  My sleep disturbances have gotten significantly worse throughout all of this, and we're on medication 5 to try and get this under control.  So far I'm not happy with it.  


So far, we've tried Trazodone, Lunesta, Nortriptyline, Doxepin, and now we're on Remeron/Mirtazapine.  It's not helping me sleep at all.  I wake up feeling tired and unmotivated (GP just increased me from 15mg to 30mg on the Remeron to help with this), and even with my ADHD medications I'm starting to have issues concentrating at work again.  I have no motivation to do anything, I haven't been able to unpack boxes sitting in my garage for the last month even though they annoy me.    I sleep maybe 3-4 hours a night, I fall asleep around 4am and wake up at 6:30am and if I can fall back asleep I wake up around 9:30 - 10am.  I have immense trouble getting out of bed.  My GP is convinced this is all related to anxiety, and that with the right dosage of Remeron that this will all go away.  While my anxiety is less than it was it's still there.   I feel like a shell of the person I used to be.  I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything really other than apathy.   GP says I need to stick this out and since we've seen ""some improvement even if I can't see it"" and once my brain chemistry balances out I'll be better, but I just feel like I'm getting worse / am not myself.  At this point the only thing that's keeping me sane at night is dabs and watching Star Trek.   Is this normal for Remeron or do I need to request a new medication?

Eventually I fell into a normal sleep schedule and had been fine until this last month, im 30 now so have been good for a while. Seems that every other night now I just can't make it happen. Started with just soft music and laying down early, then got melatonin and diphenhydramine which put me to bed the first few times but took 150mg over the course of 2hrs 2 days ago and still havnt slept, and let me tell yah, work wasn't fun the next day. Cannabis is outta the question too as I'm actively looking for a new job (having major issues keeping staff where I'm employed and its wearing on me).

1450,"Have you tried ""hacking"" your circadian rhythm through aerobic exercise? I did do some research, but also practiced it on my own to verify how possible it is to ""hack"" your circadian rhythm with the sleep promoting effects of homeostasis following aerobic exercise (drop in core body temp, blood pressure, pulse, etc).

All of these homeostatic changes promote sleep similarly to drugs when timed correctly. You have to leave a 2-3 hour window following exercise for homeostasis to promote sleep and not jump straight to bed. Apparently following exercise cortisol levels (aka stress/alertness/ the thing that doesn't let us sleep) also drop while melatonin (drowsiness / the thing we want) production is increased.

I would like to know if it's possible not to just ""hack"", but in fact to ""retrain"" the circadian clock by adopting a pre-sleep exercise schedule.

1454,"Zzzquil or Sleep-eze liquid giving me restless legs, therefore not getting a good sleep. Anyone else? So I've been having sleep issues for the last three years and I've tried just about everything including melatonin and doctor prescribed medicine. The only thing that helps me fall asleep fast is either liquid ZzzQuil or liquid sleep-Eze.

Well it might help me fall asleep fast, I get what I like to call Jimmy Legs throughout the entire night which has me waking up from that deep sleep several times.

Now it's not every time I take the liquid, it's only once in awhile, but enough to make me want to not take the stuff.

1455,"Hi, I'm a 19 year old girl and I would like some advice.     I've been dealing with insomnia for the past 2-3 years and it's getting worse.
I close my eyes and nothing happens, my brain refuses to fall asleep. I just get different scenarios in my head and hear people talking, me laughing, or crying the whole night.
     Sometimes i just go to bed at 12am and then it's 9am and i realize i didn't fall asleep at all, i feel awful and a burning pain in my chest every time this happens, and no appetite for the day, bloating.
   I tried listening to asmr and calming sounds but they don't work every day and i still don't fall asleep, if i overdo it they keep me from falling asleep cause of the sounds.
   I tried melatonin and it mostly works but not all the time, if i take it every day it starts doing the opposite effect so i need breaks for it to work again.
   I tried teas, counter meds made from plants that help you sleep, none of these worked.
  Lorazepam and anxiety medication always works the best for me. I can feel the transition of my chaotic thoughts into calmness, the lifting pain from my chest, and like myself again.
    At this point i'm considering going to psychiatrist and getting a subscription... because i've tried everything, and I realize it might be anxiety related as well. 
My dad had the same thing and was subscribed anxiety meds andk idk if maybe it's in family.

1456,"Couldn't get deep/restful sleep for years, need HELP For the last 4 years I've not really been getting good sleep. Quantified that by getting an Oura ring and realizing my deep sleep has been 30-45minutes a day (on a total avg 7hrs of lying in bed). REM similar at 30-45minutes average.

I do not have difficulty going to sleep. My struggle is getting restful sleep.

I've optimized almost everything I could for years. Blankets, temperatures, ear plugs, pitch black room, pillows etc. Avoid screens an hour before. Saw a sleep doctor and nothing much diagnosed except for very mild sleep apnea which he mentioned nothing much could be done. Tried taking melatonin (useless), i'm currently taking magnesium+theanine before bed. 

For the love of anything I couldn't figure out why. Gave my friend the ring to use to see if it's due to a spoilt ring (eliminate single point of failure?) and it returns back with his 2hours of deep sleep data.

1458,"Melatonin and Hydroxyzine Creating More Issues (HELP) A couple of weeks ago I had been trying to go to sleep earlier and bought some melatonin gummies (10mg) to help. I usually take 5mg but it was not working as well as I wanted and they were also old. The 10mg worked great getting me in the state to fall asleep and help me stay asleep for a decent amount of time. The problem, however, is that when I awoke I would feel very anxious, jittery, and irritable. To combat this feeling I would take my hydroxyzine which at first helped soothe the anxiety.

After a couple of days doing this I realized the melatonin was most likely causing the anxiety so I stopped taking it at night and started taking the hydroxyzine for sleep. For another couple days it worked fine and the only side effect was the daytime drowsiness. Unfortunately, after about 3 or 4 days using hyd to fall asleep it stopped working and I have been having issues sleeping. 

I cannot go to sleep unless I stay up for over 24 hours straight, and now I only sleep about 3 to 5 hours when I can. This has really affected everything in my life, depression, anxiety, appetite and just mood overall. It has become very frustrating and I am absolutely miserable staying up for hours trying to stay sane. 

Now I am uncertain if the melatonin was the issue of if its the hydroxyzine. I am now stopping both and trying to reach out and research more on what could help this issue. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",Melatonin
1459,"Can't sleep at nights at all I've been dealing with sleep disorder for quite a lot of years now. Currently my sleep pattern is pretty bad, just today I went to bed at 3 am, fell asleep at 5 am, only to wake up at 5:20 am and then stay awake until 8:30 am. I missed the alarm clock and woke up at 3 pm. Massive headache, hating my life for it, feeling absolutely trashed - not that it's the first time.

The only reliable time it seemed to be fixed was when I had a job with a consistent time schedule. I'm in a transition period now and I look for a new one, but this sleep pattern obviously doesn't help when looking for it.

I don't know what to do anymore. I think I tried it all, not sleeping all night (ends up with me taking a long nap in the day or none at all and still going to sleep near morning), melatonin (worked only for a few weeks), trying to go 30 minutes earlier every day (works until one day I go to bed later and all is messed up again), trying to read instead of using a phone before sleeping etc. Nothing of this works for me - or works for a short amount of time and getting back to 'default'.

All of this is making me depressed. There are days when I literally miss the sun, as I sleep through most of it. I feel like giving up and just accepting that this is how it is and that I will never function like a normal person.",Melatonin
1460,"I keep breaking down into tears. Hello everyone. I'm currently sobbing for the 4th-5th time tonight. It's 5:30 am, and this is now my third night where I've gotten no sleep. I recently just got over a horrible bought of bronchitis and I think it triggered this insomnia. It's not the first time I've experienced it. I am diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, but believe I have ADHD for background.  I had to quit smoking cigarettes now almost 3 weeks ago when I started to get sick. Which is honestly I think the last time I actually got a good nights sleep. After that I've been going to bed around 4:30-5 and waking up at 7:30 to get my son ready to go to school. I've barely had any sleep in the time I was sick because I was constantly coughing, but I thought that was mostly expected. Now that I'm better the insomnia has gotten even worse. I'm crying so hard because I have to function as a parent as I have two little ones. My partner has luckily been incredibly supportive of me, but he can't miss work so I can sleep during the day, which is something I've recently had to do. (I'm a stay at home mom btw) yesterday I slept from 8 am-1:30 pm or something like that and last night I tried to take an OTC sleep aid and it didn't work at all. I can't shut my brain off and it's starting to scare me. I just want to sleep. I have to, as I have to function and be a mom and amazingly I have been okay. I'm just really scared and I don't know what to do. I also tried melatonin which has worked before and it did absolutely nothing for me. I know I probably have to see a doctor to fix this... or something but I just feel so helpless.

Edit: thanks everyone for the advice and kind words! I did manage to get 5 hours this morning/last night and it was actually uninterrupted, as I only woke up twice which is new for me and good. I don't feel my best, but I feel better. Took 10 mL Benadryl and had to shut my phone off.

1461,"Hid all clocks, stopped waking up in the middle of the night It seems to have worked as simple as that.

I used to wake up 3-4 times a night but I knew it wasn't really a maintenance insomnia thing because after checking the time I'd fall back asleep in less than 2 minutes. I read a recommendation somewhere about hiding clocks and stuff, and damn...

I moved my clock to the kitchen so I can't see it, and I moved to the other side of the bed, so I can't easily reach my smartphone.

Now I'll wake up one time at worst. It's like my brain recognizes this handicap and doesn't bother waking me up. Maybe the sudden light from my bedside lamp or the smartphone could be messing up my melatonin or something and now it doesn't?

1462,"Rough day I don’t super-frequently suffer from insomnia. It comes and goes, seemingly at random, usually accompanied by anxiety and frustration over how much time I have left to rest. Tonight was 100% the worst insomnia I’ve ever had, though.

I got out of bed at 2PM on Monday. Sounds late, yeah, but that’s pretty par the course on days I don’t have obligations. Spent all day deep cleaning the apartment. Finished everything at about 7PM and smoked some weed to relax.

I have to work at 7AM on Tuesdays, so I try to wind down around 9-10PM the night before so I get a proper amount of sleep. I usually take Delta-8 to sleep on these nights (melatonin doesn’t work; I end up with nightmares and horrible anxiety), but I didn’t this time cuz I was already high. Unfortunately, lying in bed, I sobered up pretty fast for some reason. I ended up taking longer than normal to fall asleep so maybe around 11 is when I passed out.

...only I woke up at midnight with the distinct body feeling of “you just took a nap”. Immediately knew I was doomed.

It is now 5:30AM, I have to leave in a half hour, I’ll be at work until 2PM, and I have literally not slept whatsoever since that hour-long “nap”, meaning short of said nap, I’ll have been awake for over 24 hours by the time I get home. I don’t remember the last time that’s happened.

1464,"Insomnia Since 6th Grade hehe story time Hi my fellow insomniacs!

I've just joined the community as I completely forgot that reddit has a place for everyone.

This is my intro post that will be a rant/advice/hopeless search for understanding in the endless nights we're all familiar with.

My chronic insomnia started about 10 years ago when I gradually became unable to fall asleep- maybe sooner because I was always unable to nap as a child. Around age 12 I remember just staring out into my dark room for hours before going to class in the morning- but weirdly enough I was never really tired. Exhausted? yes. Tired? never. A year later I began seeing a psychiatrist after my brother started being seen for his ADD. She quickly prescribed me Seroquel accompanied by 1 mg Xanax... kinda interesting as a first resort for a middle schooler upon further reflection, but I digress. Two years later I had matured and realized hmm... 'I kinda don't wanna be addicted to Xanax before I can even drive' and decided to quit cold turkey. I had a day or two of withdrawal effects and continued on my journey. I then tried Belsomra which typically worked pretty well until my insurance stopped paying for it. I then tried a few other things and landed on Trazodone (100 mg) which works most nights and doesn't give me the underlying feeling that I'm an addict. Ambien also works but I think it's not recommended long-term so I only use it when the Trazodone doesn't. In between I've tried some natural remedies, OTC sleep drugs, obviously lots of Melatonin, exercise, and meditation. Nothing works. Without my medication I would honestly never sleep. I've even tried to exhaust myself into sleep, but unsurprisingly that also doesn't work. The only non-drug that sometimes works is actually Headspace Sleepcasts, though I usually listen to them when the Trazodone doesn't work so I'm already primed. My thoughts are always racing and my brain only takes a break when it's numbed by medication... sigh.

I've already read a few posts from some of y'all with chronic insomnia and it makes me feel less alone. I don't have anyone who can relate to the absolute fury I have when people ask if I've tried Melatonin or Benadryl/doctors ask if it's my sinuses or RLS- thank you for being my people who finally understand.

If you have a story like mine and have any suggestions/advice/rants please feel free to share :)

1465,"Reversed circadian rythm Hey everyone. I’ve had sleep issues for a very long time and I’m 28yo. My issue was general insomnia and I always had a later sleep schedule like 3-5am to noon or so. I was on Clonazepam for sleep for 5 years but got off of it since it was negatively affecting my health. 

After getting off I have 2 issues with my sleep, first my sleep is completely inverted. I can only sleep during the day. Anywhere from 10am-1pm to anywhere from 4pm-8pm. It’s really horrible as I never see the daytime this way and I wake up as everyone is going to sleep. 

The second issue is I wake up every hour. I’ve tried staying up all night and trying to sleep at night the following day but can only hold a schedule like that for a week before it reverts back to sleeping during the day again. The only thing I’ve noticed is if I take melatonin I can sleep a few hours early like say 8am or so.

1468,"68 hours of no sleep; mostly a rant I’m really aggravated. I have a history of bouts of no sleep. Some were more fun than others. I’m just starting to get frustrated with this one.
Ive had the auditory and minor visual hallucinations before. Usually after the 48 hour mark and I end up going to bed in around 12 hours after that kicks up. Okay. Fine.
This time really sucks.  Last night I finally got to sleep at around 12 am. Took lots of coaxing; a hot shower, hours in bed, podcasts, everything relaxing you can imagine along with melatonin and magnesium. I drift off, and I wake up two hours later from smacking into my bedroom wall. I was dreaming about something and suddenly in my dream, a snake came into the room, so I began to ran. As I felt the pain of the wall hitting my face, I even turned around and yelled out “did you grab it?” To an empty room. I then noticed my breathing was incredibly panicked, as if I had just fought for my life. I process that I’m just in my room, I’ve slept walked before, but I guess you can consider this a night terror. I thought I was getting away from a snake but I actually just jumped up from bed and ran face first as fast as possible into drywall.
So this has me a little shaken. Startled. I’m not terrified just uncomfortable. I lay back down and every single tiny noise in the room is terrifying me, so I get up.
I do a few chores. Drink lots of water. Make myself a meal. Just general self care. I decide to lay back down because I can’t focus on a single thing I’m doing and my brain is still feeling a bit jumbled.
And then a new symptom starts.
Every. Single. Time I began to drift off I began to hear very short but loud auditory hallucinations. I look into it, i guess it’s a common thing whether you have insomnia a lot, but I was genuinely feeling scared by these hallucinations everytime.
I would calm down, close my eyes, start to slip and then hear a man yell “DO IT”. There were a few other phrases.
So I got back up. Lit a candle. Am starting up a video game to clear my mind.
I’ve had sleep paralysis in the past and usually the solution has been for me to get up and do another task for a bit so it knocks it off for the night.

1469,"My Journey with Insomnia I just want to share my recent battle that I have had with insomnia, in case this inspires or helps anyone battling it. It's a horrible thing to happen, and wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. So let me give you a bit of background; I'm 24 years old, and living in the UK, my insomnia started around 10 months ago, funnily enough when I started a new job. When it started I was a bit confused as to why I wasn't sleeping, normally it was like clockwork. It started where I would try to sleep around 10/10:30, and wouldn't be sleeping until 3am, this then got worse as I also suffer with anxiety. The fact I wasn't getting enough sleep really made the nights long and full of thoughts, this would cause me to worry and then I'd get more anxious as I was so conscious about not sleeping. This resulted in many nights with no sleep, crying my eyes out and honestly thinking that this was it for me, I'd just have to live on 0-3 hours of sleep a night and that the only way I'd get out of this was if I was dead.

 

The past 2 weeks I've been sleeping really well, and it's worth mentioning I still have no idea what caused my insomina, and that's the worst bit, not knowing why it's happning, being so jealous of my friends and family over something that should come so easily, sleep should be something so easy to do. But I think by making so many changes, whatever caused it (probably a mix of lots of things to be honest) seemed to ease.

 

So I'm going to break down everything I can and really hope that this helps someone:

 

Sleepio: Firstly, I used a course online called Sleepio, and I was so sceptical at first, but they really helped identify some of the common issues of what could be causing my insomina and gave such good tips and tricks to help improve sleep health.

CBT: I also have been undergoing CBT which stands for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for the past few weeks, this really tries to change your behaviour and patterns to get improvement. I was able to find some for free through NHS, which was brilliant as I didn't want to spend endless money on a therapist, but it was getting to that point. And to be honest, I would very much recommend therapy, even if you have to pay it's so worth it. 

Routine: Get a sleep routine, this lets your body know that it's time for sleep. I now go to bed around 10/10:30, and wake up around 7am for work, even on weekends I really try and stick to it.

Get out: Get out of your room/house. I know it's the last thing you want to do when you've had no sleep, but seriously it is one of the best things you can do. I worked from my room during Covid, so my mind just didn't associate my bedroom with sleep. So I moved my office outside, and go into work when I can. It's so beneficial to get outside your house, your body needs to go out and getting sunlight helps your body produce melatonin naturally.

Bedroom Health: Had no idea how important this is, make sure you have a comfy bed/pillows/duvet, and also make sure the temperature in your room is okay. A big factor in helping me get more sleep, I invested in a sleep mask and ear plugs, there was this crack in my curtains that let in light, and I really think this kept me up. Try and keep your room as dark as possible when sleeping, I use a sleep mask because it's a cheap and effective way of getting your body to produce melatonin. I also unplug all my appliances that have a light even when it's off, just because it can interrupt your body's natural process. Also only use your bed for sleeping and sex, that's vital.

Sleep aids etc.: My doctor never gave me sleeping tablets, but in the UK you can also get slightly stronger tablets in pharmacys (over the counter tablets) which aren’t as strong as the ones the doctor would give. I had Promethazine tablets (25mg/50mg) and they did help me drift off, but it really shouldn't be a long term solution. Yes, it helps you sleep, but it's artificial sleep and long term use of these will stop your body from producing as much sleep naturally as it will rely on the tablets. You’re only supposed to take 50mg a night, and I'm going to be honest, I took up to 4 tablets when I couldn't get sleep, and I would feel awful the next day. I tried other aids, such as sleepy tea, night pillow spray (idk what this was but it didn't help me), cbd tea - sometimes these would help and I would definitely recommend trying it.

Can't sleep: Now even if you have done everything else on this list, you might still struggle with being able to drift off. At the worst of my insomnia, I was petrified of trying to go to sleep, it'd be on my mind all day and I'd be so scared to even get into bed, knowing I was going to fail. Now I'll break this down into some things that can help:

- Accept it: Guess what, sometimes you just won’t sleep, and that's okay. But guess what else? Your body can survive days without sleep, it's not unheard of. There's millions of people that are also suffering with you, in the UK 1 in 10 people have insomnia! Sometimes just letting go is the best way, so what the next day will be a bit rough, but you'll get through it, as you always do. And just tell people, I remember my first time in the office at my new job I got 1 hour sleep after taking many sleeping pills (do not do this), and it was rough, but I explained and everyone gave me space and was so accepting. Insomnia isn't talked about enough, because it's not a cold, but seriously people are a lot more accepting. Everyone I spoke to felt so sorry for me, but people don't realise how bad it is because they haven’t faced it, get it off your chest.

- Get out of bed: If you can’t sleep, get out of your bed and into another room, I know it's hard and probably the last thing you want to do, but it'll refresh your mind. If I can’t sleep I go downstairs, onto  a very small sofa (I'm 6ft3 so have to basically fold my legs up), and I lay down, and allow my thoughts to go crazy, and it's a nice escape because in bed I try to control my thoughts, but I let my mind just go crazy when I can’t sleep.

- ‘The': If your minds just not stopping, just take some deep breaths and repeat the word 'the' in your head every few seconds. The word 'The' doesn't have any impact on your brain because on its own, the word 'the' has no stimulant impact. So your brain won’t get stimulated by that word going over and over.

- Deep breaths: If you're stressed, just try some deep breaths and try to relax yourself. I know some people use the 4-7-4 trick. Breath in for 4 seconds, hold for 7 and then out for 4.

- Think about other stuff: What are your plans for the week? What are you going to have to eat tomorrow? What went well today? What went well this week? Think about stuff, use this time to plan and just enjoy the good aspects of your life.

- Write/Read: Any thoughts that keep racing, write it down and get it out of your mind and onto a page. Also try read a book an hour before sleeping, it helps so much to tire your brain out without looking at screens.

- Flip it around: A really good tactic, is pretend your situation is a friend coming to you for help. If you're worried about something, pretend it's a friend that has come to you and by pulling yourself out of the situation it can help you ease your mind and find solutions. For example, my 'friend' can't sleep and is worried how is he going to get through the day, my advice would be 'well, you've survived off of a few hours before, and you did it fine. Yeah it won't be the best day of your life, but you'll get through it'.

Work: I think starting my new job was one of the factors that caused insomia for me. Starting a new job, it was a step up and I was stressed and keen to start well. I think I was worrying too much, but you need to realise everyone's there to help you, try and speak to people and if you haven’t got any sleep and really don't feel up to working, explain this to your colleagues/manager and I'm sure they'll understand.  It's tough because everyone's different, with different jobs but if you need a break use holiday, use your sick days, and talk to people.

Relationships: My girlfriend of nearly two years has been the most supportive person throughout this. I can't thank her enough and I'm truly indebted to her. We don't sleep in the same bed much anymore, but that's okay because she's so understanding. I hope we get to  a point where we can, but honestly we have the best time when we see each other, so in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't matter if we share the same bed. Also I kind of felt pressured to sleep when we slept in the same bed, which would result in both of us having rough nights. Family and friends are all important too, tell people your issues it really helps to get it off your chest, and if they aren't very understanding, then they don't sound like the sort of people you should surround yourself with.

Alcohol: This is a weird one, when I was at university I'd be drinking all the time and sleep like a log. And when I do drink now, I sleep that night fine, but the hangxiety (hangover anxiety) would hit hard the next day and I just wouldn’t sleep. I've switched what I drink and how much I drink and it helps. Alcohol can disrupt your sleeping pattern, so be careful. Also I've switched from beer to wine or spirits. I think the gas in beer would really bloat me out, and I've researched that bloating insomnia is quite common where you’re so uncomfortable you can’t sleep.

Eating: Like with beer, my diet was so so bad (pizza, chips, burgers, takeaways). I gained weight over lockdown, and I'm still battling with it. I now try to not over eat and bloat myself out, and also I try not to eat too late because when the body is still digesting food it can keep you up. I try to have my last meal at like 6/7pm. I also try to avoid heavy carb meals that can bloat me out.

Health: I try and go to the gym a few times a week, and play football once a week. I find it helps physically tire you out, and also exercise helps release dopamine and serotonin which can really help your mind.

Controlling yourself: The amount of times I'd try and sleep at 10pm, for it to suddenly roll over to 4am, I haven't slept and I'm stressed because I have work in a few hours. I'd either have outbursts of anger and punch something (sometimes myself) or I'd burst into tears and just be crying for a solid hour feeling hopeless. It was such a weird feeling being at work, thinking to myself 'I was crying literally 3 hours ago'. I think this sort of came with getting used to the sleeplessness, now when I can't sleep I just accept it, I know it's hard to just say accept it, but you're either going to sleep or you're not, sometimes you can't control it. What you can control is your mood, try and have a bit more of a positive outlook.
 
So I know I've rambled on a bit, but I wanted to get it all out. I'm still on my journey, but now I have more good days than bad. I really hope someone reads this and it really helps them, that would be amazing knowing I've helped someone. I will say I am in no way a doctor/therapist (I actually work in IT), and all experiences are my own, I'd never advise what’s best for you, I am simply sharing my journey and experiences with insomnia.

I really hope that you get over this, speak to people and share your experiences, it really helps to get it off your chest. It's a horrible thing to go through, but you're not alone and you will get through this.",Melatonin
1470,"I don't think there's anyone more defeating than hearing ""just go to sleep, what's the big deal?"" I was diagnosed years ago with moderate insomnia. I have phases where my sleep cycle changes in pattern/frequency, with different issues occurring with each phase.

Recently, a new phase started where, I can't fall asleep. When I do finally fall asleep, it's between 11:30-12. Then I wake up again between 2:30-3, and *cannot go back to sleep to save my life*. It is causing massive spikes in my general anxiety. It is breaking me.

On day 3 of this new phase (so operating on roughly about 3-4 hours per night, I'm feeling extremely unstable, emotional, turbulent), I confide to my partner that I *desperately* need sleep and it's not coming. I tried sleeping in that morning (even an extra hour or two in the morning helps), but was met with a cacophony of noise throughout the house. Cats were barreling into the bedroom door, child was stomping through the house yelling at the cats, at my partner, just talking very loudly in general. Slamming doors, things getting dropped on the hardwood floor, cats running into things, TV being turned on with the volume set high.

I tried for 2 hours to go back to sleep, could not do it. So I come out and ask my partner, why. He knew I was trying to go back to sleep, but did nothing to try to control the general volume of house activity. Why.

He says ""just go back to sleep. What's the big deal?""

I said ""you don't seem to understand that *I can't go back to sleep*.""

He says ""just go back to bed, nothing is stopping you from sleeping.""

I lost it. I started screaming at him that yes, my brain is stopping me from sleeping, I can't think straight or remember anything right now, I'm exhausted but my eyes won't stay closed, that I have no chance of even trying with all the noise. I'm becoming a blubbering, tearful, choking mess while I'm yelling at him because I don't know what to do anymore or how to function. And hearing him say ""what's the big deal"" just crushed me. I can't seem to find the right words to use to get him to understand just how bad my insomnia is right now. And he doesn't seem to care.

I can feel that I'm teetering on a fine line of emotional stability right now. I literally can't deal with anything even mildly challenging because all it does is make me want to break down.

Smoking the heaviest hitting indica isn't helping. Melatonin isn't helping. Exercise isn't helping (just adds physical exhaustion to the pile of mental exhaustion). The only sleep meds that do anything are not covered by insurance and are extremely expensive (not to mention the weekly psychiatrist appointment required to keep the prescription, that is also not covered by insurance and is $260 a pop).

1471,"Get a sleep test y’all If you are having sleep problems and it’s really affecting your daily life, get. A. Sleep. Study. Done. Polysomnography and mslt sleep tests in a lab, not the take home one due to it being less accurate. 

Bring sleep aids with you if you can’t fall asleep easy or when uncomfortable. 

You never know when your issue is something more serious than people saying “take melatonin”. 

I learned I have PLMD and the medication to stop my body’s autonomic movement is starting to help. If I never got tested, it would just get worse and I’d never have known or be on the road to fix it.

1478,"Need some advice/help Hey everyone.  


I am a 20 year old male, who has lived with a pretty bad case of insomnia and its really taking over my life as we speak lol. I have had severe trouble in finding a comfortable time to fall asleep. I seriously think I might have some mental problem within that is disabling me from sleeping.  


I have had pretty bad sleeping habits since I was 15, I would go to sleep at like 2AM and wake up at 6 for school, it was like that for all of my highschool and only got worse with college(I graduated highschool at 16 1/2). Being a 16 year old in a University is very scary and being a first generation college student is genuinely one of the most absurd things to think about in terms of stress, expectations, and overall anxiety. However, nothing I havent dealt with before.   


The sleeping habits stayed somewhat the same? a little worse would accurately describe it. I would sleep at 4-5 AM and wake up at 8 sometimes 9. I didnt have any lectures on T/TH so I would typically sleep in and stay up all night.   


Junior year is where things ate shit. I had really bad depressive episodes and self-harmed a lot, I took pills, I developed serious hatred for my body and for myself. Could this be the reason why everything is the way it is today? possibly. I stayed up for 24-30 hours, every. single. time. It didnt matter where I was, what I was doing, I didnt mind. And now I think I am suffering quite a lot due to this. Im going into my final semester as a University student, I am as happy as I can be (a little stressed and anxious to find work but all should be good). I have a loving girlfriend, I have an amazing support group of my friends and family. I have everything I need to success in terms of being able to fucking fall asleep at a normal damn time and wake up at a normal damn time.   


So now the issue is this. I really need help, I dont wanna be dependent on any drug as even something like melatonin wont work on my body unless I dont use it for like 3-4 weeks. Which contradicts the idea of it. I try to exhaust myself, refrained from a screen hours before my sleep, taken a hot shower and cared for my body, I have tried everything you can think of. It doesnt work lol. Even when I sleep after 34 hours and go to sleep at like 9PM, wake up at like 4AM, my body compensates and then I sleep for 11+ hours. It ruins everything. 

  
I know it seems dumb but it really is bothering me and taking a serious toll on my mental state. Is there anything I can do? Please dont be rude, this is SO out of my comfort zone :/",Melatonin

1480,Only sleeping 1-2 hours or not at all in almost two weeks So let me start off with I’ve always suffered with insomnia and other mental health issues for as long as I can remember. I’m 23 years old and getting a lot of sleep has never came easy to me. I usually could function on 3-4 hours of sleep. Normally it’s my anxiety that keeps me up but idk what happened to me it feels like something in me broke. It’ll be two weeks on Wednesday where I’ve been functioning on 1-2 hours of sleep or no sleep at all. I don’t think it’s my anxiety causing it cause some nights/days I won’t even be anxious and i still can’t fall asleep. I’ll lie in bed for hours without being able to fall asleep no matter how tired i am. Nothing like this has ever happened to me and I’m scared. It has been triggering my anxiety and depression and i keep having mental breakdowns cause I’m scared I’ll never sleep again. I keep having body aches and feeling light headed. I’m scared i have fatal insomnia or sfi. I know it’s far fetched and i probably sound crazy but i haven’t found anyone who suffers with extreme insomnia like me that happen out of nowhere.

Went to the docs a few months back they said there is nothing wrong health wise. Although I do suffer from heartburn. But medication kind of brought that under control. 

The doc also recommended I talk to a psychiatrist. He gave me some anti anxiety meds and sleep meds months back and not much changed. He did ask me to do a thyroid test but I kind of missed that out. So might have to do that.

it was only since i started taking wellbutrin that i've been feeling sleepy at a decent time (so before 1-2am for me lol), like normal. before that, it was 4-5am.

lexapro also helped with sleep, as serotonin gets converted to melatonin. it helped in that totally sleepless nights were gone, but it wasn't enough, i still couldn't feel properly sleepy until dawn. wellbutrin was the game changer here.

as soon as i've been having normal sleepiness at nighttime, i realized: you shouldn't have to be trying this hard to fall asleep. i used to feel guilty and think i must have some control over my insomnia, that it is somehow my fault, but i don't really have much control, i think.

you could be more or less sedentary, playing games on your phone before bed, and forget to take your melatonin or do whatever bedtime ritual you have and you should, ideally, get the bodily cues to go to bed.

Some of you are browsing this subreddit on a regular basis, so you have likely heard a lot of what is about to follow. I came to this place only when in dire need of answers, so i want to provide the kind of condensed help i wish i found when this first happened to me. It is also worth pointing out that **my issue was the initial phase of falling asleep, not the constant waking up at night**. It has now been almost a full year since the start of chronic insomnia and i would say that my current night experiences are very close to what they were before insomnia with \~90% of the fear of insomnia gone.

# How it started

Insomnia was always always foreign to me. I never had sleep issues and could sleep pretty much everywhere. Or so i thought. There were a few events in my life that i didn't put enough attention on, and that is when there was a ""big stressful event"" coming up. Every so often, there would be something such as for example a driving license exam, a job interview, a very important presentation, some event that i would be subconsciously dreading. My conscious mind wouldn't feel like it was such a big deal, but underneath there was anxiety. So every few years when such events came up, i couldn't sleep. When it actually started being hell for me was when i noticed that i couldn't fall asleep for an hour or two. That's when the true fear really came. Running thoughts, temperature swings, knot in my stomach so i couldn't eat anything and when i became hungrier as time went on, the hunger + anxiety made me feel so ill. I felt trapped with no way out, alone and with no-one that could help me. Even if there would be someone there, what can they do? Say ""calm down""? This is certainly not something i can ring up Emergency for and even then, what can they do?

So my mind went spiraling into this feeling of helplessness and i was feeling more and more overwhelmed. I couldn't do anything but wait for the morning, knowing it's going to be a long and painful wait. I tried to eat a few biscuits or a small piece of bread every few hours and barely stuffed anything down my stomach. However, when the morning came, i wanted to get the event done with as soon as possible, putting some cold water on my face, shrugging off the lack of sleep and basically get this sh\*t done. And... that was it. The next day, i could sleep normally and i have soon forgotten about this nightmare, which happened every few years so i just ignored to look for the root of it and simply said i'm glad it's over.

Until... I couldn't do that anymore. You see, 2020/2021 were the times of dealing with our baggage and the times where it was thrown right in our face so we can't ignore it anymore. Needless to say that in the start of 2021, i was suddenly facing the same nightmare scenario, only this time there was no event next day, yet the same fear was present. Turns out that the event was only the trigger for making it harder to fall asleep, but the actual anxiety came from the traumatic feeling that i was not in control, i was helpless and that not being able to sleep means a long painful night full of terrors that will cause massive frustration. And indeed it did. The first time it happened at the start of the year, i couldn't even take a nap the next day and my body was often shaking. The anxiety and stomach issues lasted for a week, gradually fading each day. Once i was ""normal"" again, i shrugged it off and went back to work, only to get a repeat scenario two weeks later. Now a new fear arose. What if this is going to happen continuously and my life will be a constant struggle of insomnia and anxiety. It just didn't make any sense why this is happening and i felt powerless and not in control.

# The process of unraveling

The day after not being able to sleep, i was of course feeling devastated. I also couldn't eat and it felt like being stuck in Dante's inferno. After the initial shock, the first remedy to ease the anxiety came naturally...

&#x200B;

**WALKING (huge effect)**

As simple as it sounds, it did wonders for me. It was a combination of the physical act of walking that shifted the focus. I was primarily walking in nature so the change of scenery added a lot to it as well. The activity itself simply grounds me, which is what you need if you are in your head too much dealing with insomnia. I was rarely bothered to take a walk up to 2021, but suddenly it's one of my favorite things to do. I dare to say that i was even forced to embrace it, as the body-mind simply required it, and now it remains to feel good. At first i was either walking 1 to 2 hours before ""bed time"" so it cleared my thoughts a bit and allowed me to shift my focus from dreading the anticipated night, or right after a sleepless night to shake off the anxiety in the morning. This was also helpful to adjust my mindset before starting work in the morning (work from home) if i was not on sick leave. What walking at night or in the woods also allowed me was to dig deep. To introspect and talk to myself (yes, out loud). I introspected why a relapse occurred, what am i being afraid of when i can't sleep, what's the worse case scenario, how much toll does it actually take on my body and mind compared to the belief of how horrible a sleepless night was etc.

Up to this day, this is still something i swear by and now enjoy doing regardless of sleep. What i was also doing at that starting point when insomnia was at its worst and i was still trying to find out what's going on was...

&#x200B;

**Medication (small effect)**

Medication was, as for most if not all people, the logical conclusion once you feel out of control and simply want it to stop. My initial reaction to insomnia and anxiety that came from it was, that this is the worst thing that ever happened to me (if you finish reading you will see why that is no longer true) and i am desperately trying to fix it. I was at first taking a prescription sleep aid (generally known as Zolpidem) and while it did help me fall asleep, the repeats kept on coming and i was no closer to fixing it. Not only did the medication not cure the root reason, but it also got my body used to sleeping aid in order to fall asleep. Once i noticed this, i changed to over the counter version of antihistamines and gradually dosed down until i felt like i am stable enough without them. Something that i noticed made a huge difference in allowing me to get off the meds was...

&#x200B;

**Acceptance (huge effect)**

This is something that actually allowed me to cure the root cause of insomnia. Not only did i have to accept, that insomnia is not something i can get rid of in a moment, so **it may last for a while and** **that's okay**, but also gradually accepted that not sleeping is not the end of the world. As mentioned above, throughout insomnia I have discovered that i was afraid of not having control over how my night will go. Not having control over when i fall asleep or no clue how to even ""do it"". I had to accept that i cannot ""do it"". I cannot force sleep. I was also trying to find some mental tricks in order to bypass the blockage and somehow drift into sleep, which was just counter productive. I was also one of the ""lucky"" people to get constant muscle spasms as soon as i was on the brink of sleep, preventing me to actually cross into sleep. This also made me more aware that i was about to fall asleep, which just increased the mental focus again. An endless cycle of **frustration that** **i was trying to avoid**. And that was the core mistake. Only once i fully embraced what was happening without any judgement and looked at it from a positive perspective of getting out of this stronger with less subconscious trauma, was when i started to see good progress. Looking back at this, such a simple tool is so strong, yet so rarely mentioned out there. It definitely took some browsing to find out about this approach and some introspection / meditation to apply it.

I bought the commonly mentioned e-book on this topic by Dr. Guy Meadows ([https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/1499250533](https://www.amazon.com/Sleep-Book-Well-Every-Night/dp/1499250533)). I would highly suggest it, though i honestly read only the first half of it, but that was enough for me to get the point and apply it in practice. I changed my point of view of fearing the night and accepted whatever comes with open arms. It took some time but i eventually came to the point where even if i didn't fall asleep for 4 hours, i was actually still very calm and not affected by the whole situation, far from the previous version of dante's inferno, dreading soon after realizing it's one of those nights again. **Acceptance is key, resistance brings more resistance**. Accepting that i can't do anything specific to make sleep come faster and that the body knows how to do it on it's own, while the ""me"" thoughts are just in the way of it. Note that i didn't go as far as personifying my emotions and fears as the book suggests, but i welcomed all that came none the less.

&#x200B;

**Tricks of the mind (small effect)**

As mentioned above, i got to a point where lying in bed for hours and hours without sleep was no longer scaring the crap out of me (literally, lol). That's when i also started to notice a few point of view changes besides acceptance that i want to share here.

You see, i noticed a few times that i couldn't sleep for the whole night and after the 100th bathroom visit, i was wondering what the time was, as if i won't fall asleep, i might as well get up and start my work early and go for a walk. I see that i have 2 hours until alarm goes off, but i could technically get up in 40 minutes and ""start my day"". That **relieved the sleep pressure** and gave me the freedom to just lie down in a win-win scenario. I am either going to fall asleep, or will soon be done with this. I decided just to casually rest in bed and behold, i actually fell asleep and be woken by the alarm clock. So after a few of such events, whenever sleep was taking a long time to come (*note that i did not write ""whenever i had issues of sleep taking a long time"", as at this point i was not looking at it as an issue anymore, but just a happening*), apart from just accepting as mentioned above, i also took a perspective that i am not lying here ""trying to sleep"", but only resting. Just like you are resting on the couch during a nap, you have **no expectations**.

Which brings us to the topic of **naps**. What i found out (after being exhausted due to lack of sleep and then eventually forced to take a nap in order to function semi-normally), was to pay attention on how it felt to fall asleep during the nap. During dealing with insomnia, we overthink it so much on HOW to fall asleep, that we miss the obvious. Did you notice how effortless the nap was? What did you do to fall asleep during the nap? Exactly... nothing. And that attitude is what i transferred to sleeping in the evening as well. There is more expectation at night because much more is ""hanging on the line"" compared to an effortless afternoon nap, but that's only in our minds, a mere matter of perspective that you can change. Regarding the practicality of naps, i usually kept them between 30 minutes to 1h 30 minutes, depending on what my body required. I got up even if i was still feeling tired. It was still better if i pushed through the day avoiding the nap if possible, so i advise to only take naps when you absolutely must, otherwise not napping will generally help you regain the sleep drive cycle quicker.

Another thing i noticed i was starting to do was regarding thoughts when i laid in bed. Naturally, unless i was dead tired, the thoughts started to become more active when i turned off the lights. After many nights of getting in the way of myself working and managing thoughts, i found a good way of ""dealing"" with them. Imagine holding a tight clenched fist out of anger. You then realize what you are doing and you start to gradually release the grip. Imagine a mother watching over her child playing outside. You are worried he might get hurt and feel overprotective over the child. But then you realize that kids have to play and explore on their own, so you let go of your overprotective fears. It's a lot like that. You are noticing the thoughts, but instead of ""doing"" something with them once you notice them, you just gently let go. **The act of letting go is not a doing either**, it is just a natural acceptance that they are there, that they will be fine without your attention and that you can let go.

&#x200B;

**Wim Hof method (big effect)**

We talked about the walks. This goes hand in hand with them, and more. For those who are not familiar with Wim Hof, this guy tackled his trauma with breathing and cold therapy and holds a multitude of world records related to amazing feats. He also has it scientifically backed by doctors doing lab work on him. If you need more proof, google is your friend. I still do the Wim Hof method whenever i feel like it, and it still does wonders. I will split this into two parts:

* Breathing (big effect)The breathing exercise was often a life saver. Note that i was doing it on my own pace and length, but you can find the basic guided exercise for beginners here ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BNejY1e9ik&t=1s))Not only did the breathing help my body release endorphins (happy) and lower cortisol (stress), but it also gave me such a mental cleansing and sense of peace. Even during my most anxious evening mind moments, this brought me down to ""okay to slightly nervous"", while on mornings after insomnia, it just wiped my mind clean. I did the breathing before my morning walk and i was actually able to sense so much joy and understanding during the walk instead of brooding over the previous night. I also sometimes use this pre-meditation, to wipe my mind, but that's beside the point. Also since i've mentioned meditation, note that during insomnia / anxiety i was actually not able to meditate effectively to calm myself down, while this breathing really did.
* Cold showers (medium effect)Some people report great physical sensation after the cold showers. For me, cold showers represented the discipline and dedication part. Of course the body was telling me that the cold is uncomfortable so make it stop, but i was determined and focused on two things. Breathing deeply as relaxed as possible, and most importantly, **finding peace within the chaos**. I was channeling my inner zen monk, sitting in peace during a riot in the background. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist brain to see how this ties to insomnia and the mind attacks fearing the outcome. This will only help you stand in your acceptance with even greater strength. If you do decide to go with the routine of cold showers, look it up first and follow Wim's advice! **Gradual cold exposure and no forcing**. I will be honest, when a day way super rough and i didn't feel that well, i skipped the shower and only did the breathing, so always listen to your body, but know when your mind is tricking you for comfort.

&#x200B;

**Common advices that did and did not work for me**

Of course some of the things you first stumble upon are sleep hygiene and herbal supplements. The way i feel about this is that **you generally want to avoid making an event / ritual about ""going to bed""**. If you have read up to this point, you likely understand why. Here are some of the things from the top of my head:

**Did not work:**

* Sleep aid tea - this one actually if anything, made it worse as my stomach was full of liquid, making it physically less comfortable.
* Melatonin - tried it with various times and doses, no noticeable effect.
* Herbal supplement (*Ashwagandha*) - i tried two different kinds, one regular grind of bigger quantity and the other one a specialized Sensoril version. I can put the normal one into a maybe pile, as the first time i took it during the day i did notice being more mellow, but the pills were so huge it was tough to swallow. I then started ingesting the powder together with honey on a spoon and it didn't feel like it was as potent. Sensoril on the other hand did nothing for me.
* No TV before bedtime - More on this later.
* If you don't fall asleep, get out of bed - This one just made the act of going to sleep even a bigger event. I just stayed in bed and changed my point of view to resting (see chapters above) instead of constantly getting out and trying again. I did try getting up and solving sudoku puzzles while attempting to bore myself, but it just felt like avoidance. At rare occasions this does make sense if you sense it super early like 10 minutes into lying down, but over time you will get a good sense of when you feel like you are tired enough to go to bed, which prevents this from happening in the first place.
* Therapy - i don't want to go too deep into this as it would be unfair, but i will just add that i have explored this option and set up an appointment with a cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) specialist. It turned out that i was not resonating with the therapist, but it also made me realize that i want to handle this on my own. I understood that i am the most capable individual on the planet to solve my issues, as they are happening to me, but i am in no way saying therapy wouldn't work for you.
* Cannabis oil / paste - No particular positive effect.
* Weighted blanket - I'm a hot sleeper so it got hot really quickly, though the weight did have an interesting feeling. Would recommend everyone to try it out and return it if it doesn't work for you.
* Music / Audio that helps you sleep - I just can't log out if i have any sounds in the background so the lulling music, relaxing bedtime stories or asmr doesn't help me sleep, but it might work for you.

**Did work:**

* Only go to bed when you are tired - i fought against this one for so long as i wanted to stick to sleep schedules to induce sleepiness (another thing i read, but you will find this in the maybe pile below). Ultimately i found out that it was better that i stayed up an hour or two later and only get 6 hours of sleep before i had to get up for work, compared to going to bed as planned and then having 0 or 1 hour of sleep. I still extend my bed timer for 30 or 60 minutes sometimes if i really don't feel like i'm sleepy enough, but with a more normalized sleep patterns, you will have to do this less and less.
* Unwinding - This one is a double edged sword, but i will keep it in the did work pile. The reason why it can be negative is if again you turn the unwinding into a ritual that you absolutely must do in order to be able to sleep. People suggest things like hot showers for example. I tried that, and while it may have worked sometimes, my mind felt like if i skipped a shower, i won't be able to sleep. I also found that going to bed straight after mentally stimulating activates, such as strategic video games doesn't work well. So i found out my personal way of unwinding while still keeping ita) flexibleb) entertainingc) non mandatoryand that was watching TV series with my wife on the couch. If you snuggle up under a blanket and call it your personal time to relax, it has an even better emotional effect. Just don't look at this as a requirement for sleep, but find natural way to chill in the evening. Some people like to read books or listen to music, experiment, keep it non mandatory and leave the time flexible according to your needs (you maybe won't need to unwind at all as you are very tired, or maybe you are not tired at all even after 1h of watching TV. **That's okay!**).
* Getting up in the morning (even if still tired) - I will admit that i snoozed quite a few times because being sleep deprived is not fun, but this did naturally boot up a sleep cycle again. It just makes sense.
* If you wake up to go to the bathroom, ignore your thoughts - This one i added from the top of my head as i didn't really read it anywhere, but i find it hard to fall asleep again if i wake up at 6am and then start to entertain my thoughts when i lie back down. Also getting a dim night light that works on motion detection is very nice, so you don't have to be blinded by your bathroom lights, thus maintaining the drowsy state.

&#x200B;

**Sort of works:**

* Dimming lights / blue light filters - While this didn't make a difference on it's own, i guess this one doesn't hurt to put in effect regardless of insomnia. Brighter lights strain your eye more, so at least it helps your eye muscles to relax more if you turn them off or dim them when it's getting late, thus the physical feel of sleepiness is more present. I use f.lux app on my PC cutting blue light after 6pm, but i'm that kind of guy that sets brightness to minimum and cuts blue light at day as well because i have sensitive eyes. You might want to cut down your TV brightness as well if you watch it in the evening for unwinding to a level that if you close your eyes, your eyelids aren't seeing bright flashes from moving pictures on the screen and you can do some mini dozing off during the unwinding.
* Talking about your insomnia experience - Again a double edged sword. I talked heaps with my wife and often got tired of me rambling, saying i kept repeating the same things. The reason why this can also be negative is if you are an analytical overthinker, you can bury your head so deep into the sand while trying to understand the whys and the hows, that you start to become obsessed with it or simply making it a bigger deal than it deserves to be. At the same time sharing with someone makes you feel understood or at least not as lonely as insomnia can sometimes be.

**Additional help**

I would highly recommned the following youtube channel, as it was very helpful to me in multiple ways. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC\_tdQDMQon0CfD0xAbZPNDg/videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_tdQDMQon0CfD0xAbZPNDg/videos)First off, it is hosted by someone that went through what you are going through. Secondly, it hosts people that were also in your shoes and explain their way of dealing with it, essentially what you just read but in a more streamlined interview / chat way. It helps you see how common this issue is, yet how manageable it is as well. And thirdly, you can ask questions or help others in the comment section that are feeling lost. It's just a great community full of positive vibes, which is what you want when you are feeling like being in downward spiral! :) It also helped me understand why these fears are popping up and helped me find ways to deal with it. It was helpful for me to think about insomnia and processing it during the day instead of hiding away from it and hoping it will pass. Just make sure you don't go into overthinking mode about it lol, but that's when grounding walks in nature come in, helping you disconnect if needed.

# Conclusion

So there you go. If you read all the way to the end, you should have a good picture of what my journey of processing this experience was like, how i tackled it and hopefully giving you some ideas for you to try as well. We are all unique, so i would like to point out again - please feel free to only take what resonates with you and leave whatever doesn't. I can also genuinely say that during this journey through insomniaville, i have gained new understandings about myself, dug deeper than before and am generally grateful that this experience has happened. Tough things in life always suck at first, but you later find out why you had to go through it and it makes you stronger. Here's to everyone staying strong during your personal battles, know that you are loved and supported. You are never alone.",Melatonin
1501,"It’s 2 AM and I have school tomorrow My insomniac tendencies have been going on for a year, back when I was 12 and it was ok when school was online and I didn’t have to actually use my braincells but now braincells are required for functioning so… shit. Sometimes I’m asleep at 11-12 AM sometimes 4 AM. It’s never consistent, and I just want sleep, but I just lay awake hugging my dog, wondering where I went wrong in life to be in the mental state I’m currently in ((more minor but still awful) insomnia, (diagnosed) severe depression & anxiety, all that good shit) I take melatonin as well as 15 other supplements or something because I’m allergic to so much that I’m going to get vitamin deficiencies if I don’t. In total I get in average of about 3-5 hours of sleep per night, which could be way worse but I’m also only 13 so I should be getting more like 10 to be actually healthy. Sometimes I tell a story in my mind to help me sleep, something I’ve been doing since I was about 7 (back then my mom always told me I was a great sleeper, which I think was partially because of these stories) but it’s been working less and less because my anxiety finds a way to wiggle itself into the story and make it harder to sleep.

1502,"Noise-induced insomnia I used to sleep okay, but the last few years I seem to have had endless problems with doors slamming, some of the noise comes up through the foundations of the house (detached house) and we just cannot find out where it is coming from. It must be several sources. The timing seems to be random (I've kept a note of when it happens but it always varies).

I've even tried sleeping during the day, or very early or late, but still about half the time when I'm dropping off to sleep ... BAM!!!

I have thought about moving, but I did some house sitting at a few places and found that most of them were noisy too. One was absolute bliss – did not get woken up once in three whole months. I just feel like moving will be a roll of the dice, especially as this house used to be quiet a few years ago, and moving costs money and stress.

Every night I lie in bed, wondering what is going to happen. Will there be no noise, or will I be woken up 5–10 times? So now I have insomnia.

I live in a country town so there is no way to get proper technical noise reduction measures installed in the house. I have tried custom earplugs, white noise, headphones, earmuffs, melatonin, sleeping pills, you name it. I've also tried sleeping in every room in the house, including the spare bathroom and the cupboard under the stairs (Harry Potter style), but it doesn't help.

Is there anything anyone can think of that would help me either to sleep through these loud noises, or to get back to sleep fairly quickly, without being frightened and annoyed at the sudden waking? This is really driving me mad.",Melatonin

1504,"My best tips for fixing insomnia Okay so in this post I will give you my best tips learned from experience that can help you curing insomnia.

Sorry already for my english but I'm not a native speaker.

First of all, get a stable sleep schedule, for example 23-7 and try to wake up at the same time everyday (early preferably) so you get dead tired by the end of the day. Do this all the days even on weekends.

\- I don't hear this often, but working out late in the day (especially with weights) and overtraining can make it really difficult falling asleep. 

\- no caffeine at all. Even in the morning. Avoid tea, energy drinks, chocolate.

\- no carbs before bad. I find them very stimulating for the brain. If you want a late night snack aim for a protein rich food.

\- Use sleep medications as the last remedy. You should learn again to fall asleep without taking anything prior to sleep. It's easy to get addicted to them.

\- Relax before bed. It's really important. This includes not watching too exciting movies, listening to music, arguing with someone ecc. Reading and writing are the best form to calm down the mind imo.

\- For natural supplements I reccomend melatonin (you heared about it a million times), magnesium, triptophane, valerian root, chamomile. Also be sure your diet is rich of all micronutrients

\- Stay outside home as much as you can and expose yourself to sunrise, mid day sunlight and sunset so your body regulates its own clock. Also, sunlight helps the body producing vitamin D, serotonin and regulates the dopamine receptors and you will feel much better.

\- Don't over think about it. If you can't fall asleep in 30-60 minutes stand up and do something until you get tired and sleepy.

\- Avoid blue lights (phone, televisions, computers..) for at least 1 hour prior to sleep.

\- Make the room as dark as possible, no lights at all. I suggest wearing an eye mask. The air temperature must be not too cold and not too hot. Sleep under warm blankets. Wear a comfortable pajama.

\- Try to stay in the same position in bed to fall asleep. I can garantuee you will sleep in 5-10 minutes if you focus on breathing and don't move at all.

\- Make sure you don't have sleep apnea or breathing problems as the lack of oxygen in the body will wake you up.

I read magnesium produces GABA in the brain, which makes you calm. Magnesium and tryptophan also make serotonin, which are happy hormones. Serotonin makes you deep sleep. Fiber also makes you deep sleep longer.

1516,"I've recently become interested in the relationship between light and sleep ""The study showed that a street lamp with a brightness of about 10 lux would reduce a person's sleep time by 22 minutes; the recommended light brightness of 30 lux for reading would reduce a person's sleep time by 77 minutes, and a 45-watt electric bulb with a brightness of about 50 lux would reduce a person's sleep time by 109 minutes.

Researchers also found that some people's ability to tolerate light at night maybe 58 times higher than others. When the light reaches 24.6 lux, people even difficult to see the text, but it is enough to make the average person's melatonin levels by 50%; and some people in 6 lux of light (equivalent to the brightness of a few candles), the body's melatonin will be reduced by 50%; there are some people with a high tolerance capacity, only in 350 lux of bright light (equivalent to the brightness of the sunrise), melatonin will drop the same level.

&#x200B;

Sean Kane, associate professor at Monash University, says: ""The low light when reading has no effect for some people, while for others it's as bright as daylight."" While people can't test their own sensitivity to light, it's best to treat nighttime light with caution.""

If a little light can affect sleep, why does the red light of my alarm clock make me feel sleepy and fall asleep quickly?",Melatonin
1517,Trazodone and OTC sleep aides Anyone here take trazodone nightly for sleep and have some nights where it just doesn’t work? Wondering if others have taken the trazodone at bedtime and then a few hours later try something over the counter like Zzzquil or melatonin or unisom?,Melatonin
1518,"Is it safe to mix a small amount of zolpidem with melatonin? I don't have a sleeping disorder, but this seemed to be the best place to ask. I have a condition that has been causing me to wake up 2-5 times a night for the last few years. It got much worse around spring, and I would go into REM sleep very quickly, so I started taking zolpidem sulphate. It allowed me to get 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep at first, but I built up a tolerance to it very quickly.

I've made two unsuccessful attempts to quit in the last two months. The first time I tried to go cold turkey, and the second time I properly tapered down from 10mg a night to 2.5mg, but was only able to get around 6 hours of heavily interrupted sleep a night. I heard that switching to melatonin works for many people, but I heard that mixing it with zolpidem isn't recommended. I don't get enough rest with only 2.5mg zolpidem a night, so I'd like to try mixing it before quitting completely. Should this be safe?",Melatonin
1519,"I beat insomnia.. for now anyways Ok so.. i battled insomnia last summer for 2 months, and it came back late summer this year for about 2 months again. This most recent streak was much harder. I studied CBTi, read books, got professional therapy (which was a joke btw) and got a prescription for Trazadone 50mg.

In summary.. basically none of that listed above helped at all. 50mg for Trazadone was just too strong for me, i wake up or stay up feeling super groggy and blurry vision. I cut the dose down to about 10-15mg (1/4 pill) and the effects were 1000x better for me. Just like melatonin, science has proven that less is more. I also supplemented with this amazing product that in my opinion broke the cycle by killing my anxiety during the day:

I would typically sleep 3-4 hours one night, then be up all night the follow night in perpetuity. It was making me anxious and depressed to face the night every night. I was at gods mercy some nights. I thought i would be trapped forever in the vicious cycle.

Here is what broke the spell for me. :

I changed my view on insomnia. I convinced myself that insomnia was like covid or the flu.. instead of attacking my body, my mind had a virus. I realized the human body has an amazing ability to heal itself... OVER TIME. There are no silver bullets for insomnia. NONE. It may take a week, it may take 6 months but never give up hope, even in your darkest fearful night, changes will come. Whether its your environment, your lifestyle, your luck, or all of the above, our circumstances as humans will change constantly in life.

To reiterate... there is no silver bullet. period. If you take sleep meds, try to micro dose with them and play the long game with it. It won't work at first try but over days/weeks of micro dosing them you will win!

My recipe for success is

\- 10-15mg per night of Trazadone

\- 1 cortisol calm pill (link above) per night

\- Accept that ONLY TIME WILL HEAL

\- Say mantra when you close your eyes ""Fear is the only thing standing between me and everything i have ever wanted""

\- Never lose hope, you will get your life back over time. Your body is working to repair itself 24/7 even if you do not realize in the moment.

No matter what I try to take or do I still lay awake all night until 6am and then sleep until 8 or 9 if I am lucky. But even when I do sleep I can’t stop waking up.

i know that sleeping pills etc aren't the answer but it's just looking like the last resort for me right now. i have watched insomnia coach on youtube but i just can't get the hang of it.

1522,"Is it even worth doing a sleep study? What can they even learn that would help? So, I have been sleeping poorly pretty much all my life- the last time I remember sleeping through a whole night without any restlessness was when I was a kid.  It's been worse recently though.  I fall asleep OK, but on a good night I'm awake every 1.5 hours and on a bad night I only sleep in 30-45 minute bits, with a lot of frustration falling back to sleep between cycles.

I'm a little discouraged from seeking help though because I don't see many options for a treatment that would actually work for me.  I've tried various self- medication options, and a couple of the ""real"" sleep-aids, not had any results.  I was prescribed Ambien once a long time ago when I was also on Wellbutrin and the doctor gave me the Ambien pre-emptively because apparently wellbutrin can cause poor sleep- it was great the first night I tried it but nearly useless after that.  I tried Trazodone just one night (got it from a friend, not prescribed) and that was useless, don't know if it would be any better if I took it consistently.  I tried cannabis (half a gummy of CBN/THC blend) and felt terrible and didn't help me stay asleep at all.  I've tried all kids of herbals and melatonin and crap but none seem to help except lavender oil, and that's only a small improvement.  Can't take much now anyway because I'm pregnant.  Pretty sure I don't have sleep apnea- I'm skinny and don't snore, and already am a side sleeper.

The other problem is that I have a night job.  Partly due to my naturally broken sleep schedule, I figured if I was going to be up all hours of the night anyway I might as well get paid for it.  I work overnight ER veterinary medicine, and usually get to sleep some at work because we're most often not busy enough to keep me running all night.  During this time, I can't be taking any sleep aids that would impair me.  At home, I also don't want to take anything that would leave me impaired if I had to wake up, because I have young kids and they might need things at night (also new baby coming who will definitely need things at night).  I practice some parts of sleep hygiene like keeping the bedroom darkened and only using bed for sleep/sex, but keeping a regular routine and schedule is basically impossible without changing my entire life around.

I live in the glorious US of A, and my insurance deductible is $5k, so I'm reluctant to go consult with a sleep professional unless I have some real hope that I'm not just wasting my money for them to shrug and prescribe me something I can't use.  I'm posting here looking for stories of people who got useful information from a sleep study or doctor/sleep expert that actually helped them and gave them info they could not have gotten from the internet.

TL:DR- please tell me how a sleep specialist doctor was actually helpful in a way that made them worth the money.",Melatonin

1524,"Probably a stupid question (melatonin) So I've struggled with falling asleep for the last four months.  Smoking pot helped me alot of the time but I'd try and fall asleep without it and I'd lay in bed until 4 am.  This kind of turned into a sleep anxiety for me. 

I thought I would try 1.5 mg of melatonin and I've been shocked at the results. I slept 8-9 hours for the last few days and I'm excited.  

If the melatonin is working really well for me, does that just mean that my internal clock was simply screwed up the whole time and I kind of ""created"" this whole sleep anxiety that required weed to numb me out?

1525,"Idk, I guess I just need some advice or to vent /rant I can't really think properly. So for the last 2 weeks straight, I'm not sure if it's because of my cycle starting soon or what. But I've never experienced insomnia or loss/lack? of sleep this bad. 
My day to day life has been somewhat normal. Some days are a little lazier than others but I always try to stay active. 
I feel sleepy at night still and we don't go to bed later than 10pm usually.
We fall asleep and when 3am hits my eyes pop open. I'm uncomfortably awake. For the first week I just tossed and turned hoping and wishing that eventually I'll be able to fall asleep. Yet I don't, 2 to 3 hours later my bf alarms go off and I'm awake for all of them. Sometimes I'd nod off between him getting ready and saying goodbye to me but it's never a solid sleep.. I usually have dreams when I sleep that I remember but for the last week it's like I'm half awake and half asleep and the dreams seem like daydreams almost or I question if it's real life or a dream... last night was the worst. 
I woke up at 3am again and said alright I'll get up and go lay down in the living room. I tossed and turned for an hour and a half and it felt like 5 mins 😐 I'm not even sure if I slept or was in the inbetween.. 
We're going to look at some melatonin today other than that I'm totally at a loss for what I should do. 
I'm quickly approaching the breaking point. Almost crying because I'm so frustrated because I am tired! I feel so tired today. And i feel sick in the morning like I've been up all night.

1526,"The only thing that worked for me Hey everyone, I created this account in the hopes that I might get the message out to someone who is struggling like I was. Also hoping to prevent anyone from trying CBT-i as it was the worst thing to ever happen to me. If you have insomnia, stop everything, go out and buy the book Set It & Forget It by Daniel Erichsen - I got the e-book and it literally changed my life (slept 6 hours the night after reading). For good measure, get NATTO (same author) too. At its worst, my insomnia was so bad I was sleeping 1, 2 hours a night, having massive panic attacks, obsessing about sleep all day long. My anxiety manifested as a weird drunken dizziness and I became (ironically) bed ridden for a week. I have tried literally everything you can think of - acupuncture, melatonin, valerian, Zoloft, trazodone, zopiclone, olanzapine, chiropractors, meditation, yoga, naturopaths, CBT-i, teas, hot baths, exercise, low carb, high carb, eating before bed, CBD, avoiding food for hours before bed, a hush blanket, ear plugs, eye masks literally everything - I'm sure there's stuff I'm missing on this list. (spoiler - this is the problem! It will only make your insomnia worse)

He runs an online coaching program and I worked with him for 8 weeks - but literally every piece of information he has is available for free on his YouTube channel. He also answers every question personally in the comments section. If you're freaked out right now, know that there is a way out! My insomnia started as maintenance, then turned into crazy adrenaline rushes, hypnic jerks, twitches, chest pain, heart palpitations, crazy anxiety as I mentioned before, then difficulty falling asleep and probably other variations I'm forgetting. I promise you it will get better and you will sleep again!

important sleeping psychology: 
when going to bed don't think ""i have to fall asleep quick"".

1532,"Screaming in my sleep Around the last week or two I started screaming in my sleep. Sometimes it’ll be during a nightmare. I’ll become vaguely aware that I’m in a dream and try to scream in real life, but I can’t move. Eventually I’ll fall fully back into the dream, then the cycle repeats. Many times during a nightmare I’ll try to wake myself up but I don’t have the physical power to move or wake up. So I’ll be stuck in the nightmare scene, or stuck in that half conscious phase when you can barely peek your eyes open and can’t move. Then I fall fully back asleep. Usually there’s lots of thrashing. While I can’t do fine movements like open my mouth or my wrist, feet, fingers etc. I can sometimes jerk an entire limb a little bit if I use a lot of energy

Sometimes I randomly just scream and I don’t remember any nightmare, just screaming. Sometimes it’s words like “no” or “help” but usually it’s just noise. My mom remarked that I was screaming a lot when I napped today but I only remember screaming once, so I guess there’s times when I’m screaming and I’m not aware at all.


Maybe five years ago I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Also with insomnia, but my psychiatrist said it’s most likely caused by the anxiety and depression. I’ve been on many antidepressants and a few sleep aids. Prozac, Luvox, lexapro. Didn’t work. Currently on around 200 something Effexor and something near the recommended max dose for Wellbutrin. I don’t feel like they’re doing much either.

I used to take melatonin to fall asleep, but it wouldn’t keep me asleep. I used to wake up almost every hour of the night for ten minutes or so. So I was prescribed trazodone as well to keep me asleep. 

Eventually I could stay asleep and only wake up once or twice. I stopped with the sleeping meds. No matter what dose, I always felt like I got some kickback from trazodone the morning after. No matter what I took, or how much I slept, sleep has almost never felt restful. I’m always exhausted, I fall asleep during lectures, and I often need to nap during the day to have any energy

Every few weeks I’ll have a burst of days in a row where I’ll have vivid nightmares. Sometimes they’re recurring or have continuing plots, sometimes related to real life, sometimes just an immense fear and panic sensation.

I’ve screamed in my sleep a handful of times randomly in the past year. But now it’s nightly. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s exhausting and it takes so much energy to try to wake myself up. 

I feel fear and dread every time I need to head to bed. My cat sleeps with me and I have a weighted blanket which is comforting but it’s still so scary.

1538,"Tried Belsomra last night. Here's my report. Normally, I can't sleep without meds. Like, not at all, or very poorly. This has been a problem for over 40 years and has gradually gotten worse. I don't have any other mental disorder. If I sleep well, I feel great, and function well. I take a small dose of Seroquel at bedtime, along with 1.5 mg. Lunesta and melatonin. I've been doing this for a long time, it works reliably, very few side effects, and I don't seem to be getting tolerant. Still I worry about tolerance and other problems. So, I talked my psychiatrist into prescribing Belsomra. He was dubious. He has not heard good reports about Belsomra from his colleagues and he has never prescribed it, though he, like most psychiatrists, treats a lot of insomnia.

30 tablets, 10 mg. each, cost me about $450 and my insurance doesn't cover it. Thirty 20 mg. tablets cost about the same. They're made in rock-hard little tablets with rounded faces, so they are hard to split in half, though it could probably be done with just the right pill-splitter.

I took 10 mg., along with my usual melatonin,, no other meds, waited about 90 minutes. Didn't feel sleepy, didn't doze of, at all. As per doctor's instructions, I took another 10 mg. About 45 minutes later, I dozed off into very light sleep with lots of disturbing, vivid dreams, along with sleep paralysis. Struggling frantically to wake up from a BAD dream, repeatedly, is pretty horrible. I also got some false awakenings -- struggling mightily to wake up from one dream, thinking I'm awake, when really, I've just started another dream, worse than the last one.

This went on for about 4 1/2 hours. Then I woke up, far too early, not at all rested, feeling terrible. NOT a good experience.

Every brain is different. I understand some people are happy with Belsomra, but apparently not many. The pharmacy said they have never filled a prescription for it before. I don't think it is going to work out for me. If you've not tried it and you're desperate for relief, and you can afford to try it, it's probably worth a try.

I have to go in tomorrow and I am so scared that tonight is just going to be the same thing again. I’ve tried Benadryl, unisom, melatonin, sleepy tea, and THC and nothing works. I am having so much anxiety about this whole situation, I would really appreciate it if anyone has any advice.",Melatonin
1545,"Insomina sufferer for past 10 years To this day I do not know what caused my insomnia. Before it started I was a great sleeper I never had trouble sleeping or falling asleep. In july of 2007 is when it started.  I was working at a difficult job with a really unfriendly and gossipy bunch of young woman. I did one over night shift. I don't think that did it. I think it was the stress of the job/the environment/my life circumstances/family issues/unresolved trauma that caused it. I was unable to sleep I would have a racing heart and go into a total panic. I would go weeks without sleep, I started to hallucinate, I  was so anxious I would shake.I felt completely unhinged. I went to a sleep study and they found I have ""hyper arousals"" thorough out the night. The results did show I reach REM, but i clearly remember no sleeping tossing and turning and going into my usual panic.  I tried melatonin, i tried z quil, i tried herbals, I tried CBD, then I turned to prescriptions, ambien, lunesta, trazadone. nothing helped. I felt hopeless and on the verge of suicide, I wrote a suicide noted, I made a plan, I threw out my belongings. I went to a Psych he said why dont you try seroquel. i did and IT WORKED. but I gained so much weight, my knees hurt, my bladder was weak, and my blood sugar and cholesterol skyrocketed. But i made me sleep. I finally got a real job because I could sleep now. I felt so relieved. but now Im considered obese and my cholesterol is sky high my dr said i have to go off it. I weaned off slowly, now im on 12.5mg and i also started gabapentin 300mg and doxepin 10mg. for 3 days i tried no seroquel but I could not sleep whatsoever tossed and turned. no what? will I be stuck on this forever. has anyone had any luck going off seroquel?",Melatonin
1546,"Any suggestions for a short (but tired) sleeper? For the past few years, I've slept for around 4 hours per night. I have no problem falling asleep every night around 11pm. I then wake up around 3am to use the bathroom. (I'm a male in my late 40's.) From there, I'm up for the day. My brain becomes very awake and wants to think about work deadlines. When I report to work at 8:30am, I'm already tired after being up for 5 hours. By 3pm, I've been up for 12 hours. It becomes a long day.

I've tried: Melatonin, CBD, CBN, Magnesium, Niacinamide. I have dim lighting for my trip to the bathroom. I don't look at my phone. But still--my mind is awake.

Everything I've read says that 4 hours per night is not good for long term health. Why is it so easy to fall asleep at 11pm and so hard to fall asleep at 3am? Any suggestions? Thanks!",Melatonin
1547,"Can no longer sleep after taking Lexapro should I take ambien ?

1548,"Last few days, just haven't been able to sleep at all I'll get few hours of sleep, or none at all. End up knocking out in middle of day however. But tonight, right now even, I'm having auditory hallucinations. I walk around room to see where it's coming from. Maybe neighbors having a party or something. But there is no source. I thought maybe I'm hearing my fridge, and it seems like music. But nothing. Songs are even switching. I'm on third song, idk even know what it is. I can barely make out singing and instruments. Imma try melatonin to knock my ass out. Hopefully that'll help",Melatonin
1549,"I wake up multiple times a night It’s going on for months now. I just wake up after 3 hours of sleep and I cant fall asleep again until morning. 
I followed all the sleep hygiene tips possible.
I’m using melatonin and mirtazapine but they wont make me sleep again during night.

I need help. It’s ruining my school year because I’m always late. I just cant wake up with under 6 hours of sleep because I forget things easily and I’m super stressed and angry.",Melatonin
1550,"I’m new to insomnia- it feels like d3ath Hi. I’m not sure what my cause or reasoning is as to why I have insomnia. I just graduated college (from a rigorous program) (which i never really had sleeping issues before or really during college - some occasions tho due to stress).

Now I am working a job 3p-12a (which I feel is part of the reason) - anyways, for some odd reason it’s like I’m getting really excited for something- it’s like I have heart palpitations and my thoughts do not stop racing etc… the thoughts that go on in my head are fuc*ing bizarre!!!! Like things I don’t even care about or want to think about. It’s like I start with 3 tabs open and within 6 seconds there are 73 tabs.. Google can’t even catch up.

Anyways,
I went 10 days without ANY sleep and wanted to di3. Literally. I tried Melatonin, CBd, weed, Hydroxyzine &amp; zzzquil. (I was prescribed Hydroxyzine a few months ago for anxiety- but never took it because I was afraid and felt I had my anxiety “under control”)

None of those worked except zzzquil (note: I only took 5mg of the Hydroxyzine when I tried to use it 1x because of how scared I was) zzzquil- I’ve been taking regularly for almost a month now- which fuc*king scares me because I know I shouldn’t be doing that and I HAVE MEDICINE ANXIETY ☠️🙈. Idk what else to do. I try not to take it occasionally- which literally leads me to lying awake for hours (it’s 4:30am as I type this now).

I’ve done my research - which mostly states “don’t just lay there, get up and do something else until you’re tired” etc. ya. I do that too- I’ll clean, read, “meditate” etc. nothing is working 

I’m more concerned with the fact that this is happening all of a sudden?!

Note: I feel as if I am also stressing out / anxious about taking a boards exam which is next month - which may also be the culprit of my issue. 

Help.

1551,"Any help? I think I’m starting to get the hang of fixing my insomnia. So I’ve been having insomnia for two months, my psychiatrist ruled it out yesterday and I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow. 

So I’ve had this for two months, I work out often, I eat well, I practice mindfulness and even keep my bed clean. 

I’ve been on Zopiclone for a while, but it started becoming ineffective after desperately relapsing, so I’m tryna use melatonin and herbal tea at most. 

For the last 3 days, my stamina has been terrible, shockingly I think it’s done some damage to my lungs, I live with clean air and I don’t smoke, no asthma neither, but I’ve felt my body going in a decline, if I don’t fix my insomnia it could severely damage me. 

So what can I do? My circadian rhythm isn’t messed neither, I’d get sleepy around 11-12 at night, and wake up painfully at 3-4 am, I’d desperately try sleeping again but it’s useless. The only issue is, I can’t sleep for longer than 4 hours. 

Also, what do y’all think the doctor’s visit is gonna help me out with?",Melatonin
1552,"Decided to make a big cup of herbal tea + 1mg of melatonin. I added a tablespoon of chamomile, a bag of Tetley’s Super Immune tea with zinc + vitamin containing ginger and peppermint, cinnamon and a bay leaf. 

Also adding a gram of melatonin before I sleep. And if these don’t work, guess I’ll go back on Zopiclone. 

Goodnight everyone <3",Melatonin
1553,"Can’t sleep… again I haven’t been able to sleep before 2am for the past week. I’ve often slept through my alarm the next day and missed classes that I need to be at. I’ve tried calming exercises and sleep music, they don’t help. I can’t use melatonin because last time I did, I developed a dependency on it. Valerian root supplements just make me nauseous. I walk a lot during the day and my course load is definitely tiring enough. I just can’t sleep and it’s so frustrating. I feel awful.",Melatonin
1554,"Melatonin doesn’t work. Ambien doesn’t work. I’ll take both and I’ll toss and turn and toss and turn. If I do fall asleep it’s for an hour or less and I can never stay asleep. 
It’s severely affecting my mental health and I’m just… I’m so tired. All the time. But when I try to sleep it’s like forcing a cube through a circle hole. 
I’m getting maybe 4 hours on a good night. 
It’s affecting my relationship.

1555,"Anybody here tried thyme? The herb. I've had beneficial effects with 1/16 teaspoon this and recently combining with 1mg melatonin. Wonder if anybody else tried thyme. 

I gave a highly reactive body, I can feel anything I put in it to the smallest amount. My insomnia is food related due to LGS/allergies, and shit getting into my brain that should not be there or that I'm allergic to. Totally bland diet relieves insomnia. Just a little background.",Melatonin
1556,"CBN for long-term sleep problems - any experiences? Hello, I have been struggling with sleep problems for a very long time. I need to take zolpidem 7.5mg with promethazine 25mg(an antihistamine drug) every night, to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep. For most of the nights, a combination of zolpidem + promethazine works, but not always. And sometimes, even after 8 hours of sleep, I feel like I wasn't sleeping at all (I feel exhausted, tired...but I can't go back to sleep during the day or take a nap). I also take valerian (800mg), melatonin (6mg)...but they work more or less like a placebo.

Recently I bought a CBN oil from a Swiss company (it's THC free). I've been taking it every night for about a month. The recommended dosage is 3-5 drops under the tongue before sleep (it's 300mg/10ml bottle). 

In the beginning, I had an impression that it was helping a little (it made me feel a bit more tired, sleepy), but still, I couldn't fall asleep without taking zolpidem. Even with 5 drops, I may wake up during the night, and not be able to fall asleep afterward. 

&#x200B;

Can you please share your experiences with CBN for sleep? Should I try to take more drops? Is there an even better-stronger cannabinoid variant, especially for sleep problems? 

&#x200B;

I am located in eastern Europe, I can only try THC-free products.

Thank you!",Melatonin
